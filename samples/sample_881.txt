It's no surprise that after the last few days on Wall Street, people have been a little edgy.\n\nPerhaps that is why one investor felt compelled to send a four-page letter to Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett after the company reported earnings last week.\n\nThe letter is the type of thing you might expect to receive from a crazed, crazy fan, but Berkshire actually receives similar messages all the time.\n\n"There are dozens of letters like this that we receive every year," the company's vice president of investor relations, Bruce R. Thompson, wrote in a follow-up letter to the original.\n\n"Our stock has performed so consistently well for so long, that the temptation to weave a web of fiction around it is understandable," he said. "Our job is to ignore the weaving and focus on the facts and the future."\n\nThompson provided an excerpt of the letter to CNBC, which says in part:\n\n"My hope is that you're on the verge of declaring a national emergency to break up the banks, use the FDIC to buy equity in the banks, give debt forgiveness to homeowners, and have the government issue each American a lifetime guaranteed income of $25,000."\n\n"We are in the midst of a dying civilization, where self-serving financiers, politicians and corporations are pillaging all the resources, making the citizens serfs, and impoverishing the nation."\n\nThompson said that Buffett was not responsible for responding to every letter, but in this case, he decided to weigh in.
