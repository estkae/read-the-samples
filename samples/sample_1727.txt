"Yearly Meeting clerk David Chappell, who joined us in the studio in January 2018, will be meeting up with the members of the House of Bishops, who are due to visit Tyneside in February 2019. He reports back on the latest news and details of the 2019 event, the tenth of its kind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach year, the Bishops visit the meetings of the Methodist Church in their Province to listen to the stories of our work and witness the work of God in the lives of our local communities. It's a great opportunity for us to hear the stories of others and share in what God is doing in our churches.\n\n\n\nIt's a great honour for Tyneside to be chosen as one of the 2019 stops for the Bishops' visit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, the Bishops visited parts of the North East of England, and heard a wide range of stories, from St Kentigern's, Burnmoor, Whitley Bay, to Monkton Stadium, Sunderland, and also saw the work of our Youth and Children's departments, which both won national awards.\n\n\n\nIn 2019, Tyneside will host the Bishops at Bishop Middleham School in Durham, and at John Gladstone School, Newcastle. It will also be our opportunity to celebrate our work in being awarded Christian Schools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bishops will then meet for lunch at the Masonic Lodge, on Tuesday 13th February, before travelling back to London.\n\n\n\nThe Committee which is organising the event has been working hard to arrange transport and travel for all the Bishops, their wives, and the lay members of their staff. They have already had several meetings to arrange and confirm the details. We have arranged a coach to collect the Bishops from Bishop Auckland, and the next step is to sort out all the details for the visit to Durham.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year we are also celebrating the 400th anniversary of the birth of George Herbert. The Bishop of Durham, Rt. Revd Paul Butler, will be leading a service at Durham Cathedral to celebrate the life and ministry of George Herbert on the evening of Monday 12th February. It would be great to have as many people as possible attending, as it's a chance to be a part of something which will have a big impact in Durham, and also across the country.\n\n\n\nWe hope to see you in Durham and for the visit to Bishop Middleham School, Bishop Auckland, on Tuesday 13th February, for a great time of fellowship.\n\n\n\nClick here to find out more about the 2019 Bishopsâ€™ Visit to the North East.\n\n
