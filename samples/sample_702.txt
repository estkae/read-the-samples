Security staff at a New York City airport reportedly refused to believe that Senator Chuck Schumer was a member of Congress.\n\nMr Schumer, a Democrat from New York, said he was travelling back from a trip to Europe with other members of Congress when security stopped him at Newark Liberty International Airport.\n\nHe tweeted that security had told him he could not board the plane because his name was on a list of those not allowed to fly.\n\n“I presented them with my passport and my driver's licence and explained that I was on the Senate intelligence committee and that I was flying back from a trip to Syria and they said ‘the computers aren’t talking to each other, I’ll talk to you in a few minutes,’” he told WCBS-TV.\n\n“And then a few minutes later, they said ‘the computers still aren’t talking to each other but we’ll let you go.’”\n\nThe New York Post said Mr Schumer's name was a "hold" on the system, meaning he was on the "selectee list" of those not allowed to fly.
