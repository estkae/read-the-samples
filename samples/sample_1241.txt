A high school librarian in Atlanta will be suspended for one day without pay after challenging a policy banning African-American authors in his classroom.\n\nAtlanta Public Schools' office of human resources has recommended a one-day suspension without pay for Donald T. Sobers, director of library services for the West End High School, according to a district spokesman.\n\nIn September, Sobers told administrators that he felt uncomfortable in his position after he was told he was not allowed to display literature by black authors in his classroom.\n\nIn a letter to school officials, Sobers said the school's policy violated his First Amendment rights and the federal Equal Educational Opportunities Act.\n\n"I find it highly inappropriate that the school system does not see fit to have black history taught, but does not hesitate to use black children to staff our schools," he wrote.\n\nSobers and the school system reached a settlement earlier this month that gives him a one-day suspension without pay. He agreed to drop his appeal to a grievance hearing. The school system also dropped the request to remove Sobers from his position as librarian, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nSobers, who is black, said he was willing to fight the system to make sure that black children get a history education.\n\n"If that means I'm going to be the sacrificial lamb to help those students, so be it," he told ABCNews.com last year.\n\nThe school system's policy against the display of certain books was a common one at Atlanta schools, Sobers said.\n\nIn a memo to Sobers, school officials said, "African-American authors, at this time, will not be included in our collection development efforts."\n\nThey also said the policy was not meant to single out any particular group of authors, but "is part of a larger collection development strategy to keep our school libraries relevant to the lives of our students."\n\nSobers said the policy violated the Equal Educational Opportunities Act and his First Amendment rights.\n\n"It doesn't make any sense," he said. "All it does is present a real big gap in history and the ability to analyze society in terms of what's going on."\n\nSobers said he has found that some students have a hard time when they encounter racism in society.\n\n"The problem is that these children are not getting an accurate historical perspective," he said.\n\nSobers said he will use his one day of suspension to spend the day visiting students in the school library and to continue his campaign to have books by black authors included in school libraries.\n\n"I feel strongly about this," he said. "I'm trying to change it."\n\nSince Sobers' story came to light last year, black authors have started writing to school libraries, encouraging them to include black literature in their collections.\n\nOne of them, filmmaker Spike Lee, said he was "appalled and embarrassed" when he heard Sobers' story.\n\nLee donated a dozen copies of his film "School Daze," a satire on race relations at a fictional college. The DVDs are displayed in the school library.\n\n"I felt, we've got to do something," Lee told ABCNews.com last year.\n\nLee said he didn't expect his gesture to start a movement.\n\n"But I hope it does," he said.\n\nSchool district spokeswoman Kimberly Willis Green told ABCNews.com in September that the policy to ban black authors from schools will remain in place until the superintendent reviews it.\n\nThe district has not yet released the full recommendation, but the suspension is standard for any supervisor who violates a policy, according to Green.
