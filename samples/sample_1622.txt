"Congressional Record Statement of Rep. Frank Pallone\n\nDelivered in the House of Representatives, July 30, 1998\n\nIt is an honor to speak today about H.R. 3700, the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1998, introduced by my colleague from New Jersey, Representative Rob Andrews.\n\nThis legislation will help us address the significant problems that exist in our drinking water.\n\nFor example, as many of my colleagues know, chlorinated water can give off the toxic gas chlorine. Although the Federal Government has known about the dangers of chlorine gas since 1921, we do not know how many water systems in this country are vulnerable to the effects of chlorine gas because we do not know the proper standards that must be in place to protect people from chlorine gas.\n\nAnother problem that exists with our drinking water is that many of the chemicals that are currently used in water treatment facilities are extremely dangerous. For example, asbestos, a known carcinogen, is one of the chemicals currently used.\n\nLast year I introduced legislation in an effort to address the problems that exist in our drinking water. My legislation was designed to help ensure that the American people would not be exposed to toxic contaminants in their drinking water. This legislation passed the House of Representatives in the last Congress by a vote of 406 to 17. It had support from a wide range of organizations, including the National Association of Local Boards of Health, the American Public Health Association, and the American Medical Association.\n\nUnfortunately, we are still not able to achieve the reforms in drinking water policy that we so desperately need.\n\nAlthough my legislation was bipartisan, the Republican leadership in the Senate never brought the bill to the floor for a vote.\n\nH.R. 3700, introduced by Representative Andrews, does not address the same problems that my legislation did. I will work with the bill's sponsors to address my concerns regarding this legislation as it goes through the legislative process.\n\nThis bill provides assistance to States to pay for water systems that fail to meet health standards.\n\nThis bill also provides money to update the Safe Drinking Water Act to account for the problems associated with contaminants, such as asbestos, that are being used in water treatment facilities.\n\nAdditionally, this legislation is designed to provide funds to States to remove underground storage tanks that contain fuel. These tanks are known to contaminate groundwater.\n\nI have worked with the Administration and have offered them some suggestions regarding the bill. I will be working with my colleagues to address my concerns regarding the bill.\n\nI will be working to add additional funding for assistance to those States that are in the process of implementing new water treatment facilities. I believe that the more funding we can provide, the better the chances that we will be able to assure the safety of our drinking water.\n\nSource: http://pallone.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=116382
