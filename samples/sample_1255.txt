This brand new Official Armani Eau de Parfum for Women (EDP) comes in a stylish box, in line with all other Armani Eau de Parfums. The box is not so heavy and it feels nice to hold.The perfume bottle is shiny. On top, there is an Armani logo. On the bottom, you can find the name of the perfume.\n\nI like the appearance of this new perfume. It looks fresh and shiny.\n\nThis Armani Eau de Parfum is unisex, but it is an elegant perfume for women.\n\nThe perfume bottle is transparent, but the liquid is coloured light pink. I have read that the colour of the perfume was chosen so it could match the colour of the box, which is also pink.\n\nThe spray is strong, so one spray is enough. When you spray the perfume, you can feel a very nice, light scent, which is very similar to the original Armani Code, but it’s not as strong as the original Armani Code Eau de Parfum.\n\nThe perfume lasts about 6 hours. The first hour, you can feel the perfume the most. The second hour, you can smell it a little bit. The third hour, you can smell it less.\n\nAs I said before, this new perfume is a very elegant, very light and nice perfume, but not very long lasting. If you want a longer lasting perfume, you should check out the other Eau de Parfums of Armani.\n\nPrice and availibility\n\nThe perfume is available at the official Armani Online Store and costs £40 (approx. 44 euros).
