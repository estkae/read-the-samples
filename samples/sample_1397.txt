a condensed guide to remove the duplication in an original table of contents in a book\n\nTo add a further level of duplication, the table of contents will be extracted from a book that has one in order to create a second one, then combined with the first to create a third.\n\nMy sister, Linda, and I have spent the last ten years extracting tables of contents from books and magazines, and a few other items.\n\nAs with so many things in my life, it all started because I was looking for something and I found something else instead.\n\nThe first time I extracted a table of contents from a book, it was for a university assignment. I had been studying French history, and was given a very large book on the French Revolution. The book had a number of useful appendices, but I was most interested in the one titled, A Chronology of the French Revolution.\n\nThere was only one problem. The appendix was part of a larger volume and it was far too heavy to carry around and read on the bus or the train to and from class. I needed a copy of the appendix that I could take with me. But how?\n\nIt was simple. A few photocopies later and I was able to use the book to guide me through a history I was only just starting to understand.\n\nA couple of years later, I was given a copy of The Guinness Book of Records. It was a gift for my 10th birthday. I wasn’t even sure what it was when I unwrapped it. But, boy, was I glad I had it a few weeks later when my best friend came over to visit.\n\n“You gotta come see this!” he said, “I think it’s the best book ever.”\n\nHe showed me the page with the longest words and longest numbers. It didn’t seem like much of a competition to me. But I had just found the best way to impress my friends, especially if it involved big numbers or big words.\n\nFrom that point on, I spent a lot of time with the Guinness Book. It was a fascinating book to a ten-year-old. My sister had told me I had to read it before I could look at the television. It had pictures of all the characters in Star Wars. It also had a comprehensive section on how to make a nuclear bomb.\n\nEventually, I discovered an interesting thing. I was the only kid I knew that could take any television commercial and cut it down to its most important phrases. “Buy, buy, buy!”, “More, more, more!” and “Who needs the phone when I can just drive my car into the supermarket and buy what I want from the grocery store!”\n\nI’d only seen the commercials a couple of times, but I had an amazing memory for what they said.\n\nFrom this point on, I wanted to understand the commercials. I wanted to understand the words and phrases they used. I had a new goal in life. It was time to study linguistics.\n\nBut, first, I had to get a degree in something else.\n\nI was studying film. I was taking a lot of English and Linguistics courses. I spent hours in the library researching movie scripts, and other people’s attempts at a good story. I studied story, scene, and character structure. I read a lot of books.\n\nThen I decided I wanted to write a story.\n\nI read the books and the screenplays. I took notes. I scribbled ideas.\n\nThen I began to outline a story.\n\nI had a good beginning. I had an ending. But I didn’t have a middle. And it was going to be a very long story. I needed something to fill in the time in between.\n\nBut what?\n\nI could’ve made something up. But, after all those writing courses, I knew that my imagination didn’t have the skill or the expertise to pull it off. And what if someone else used the same ideas? It could be my story, but it wouldn’t be my idea.\n\nThe other option was to take an idea from something I had already read. I was into comics. I read a lot of them. I’d see comic strips in newspapers and wonder if they could be anything other than one or two frames long.\n\nThen it occurred to me that I’d already seen the main character in my own life.\n\nThe main character in my story was going to be someone who was very different from me. He was going to be Jewish. He was going to be short and fat. And he was going to have trouble with the opposite sex.\n\nI found him in Archie Comics. I loved the comics. I used to buy them by the armful. I knew a lot about Archie and Betty and Veronica. I knew everything about them.\n\nBut what I really wanted to know was about the rest of the family. So, I did a little research and discovered that I had enough information to create a backstory for them. I took a few of the comic strips I had written and rearranged them to create a single sequence. I didn’t like the idea of rearranging things. I didn’t like it because I liked the original version.\n\nSo I decided to turn it into a comic strip. I photocopied the panels and filled in the words. I had created a complete story. It was kind of a comic strip, but it was also a story. It wasn’t long. It was about 10 pages long. It had a beginning, a middle, and an ending. It was a complete story.\n\nI showed it to my friends and they loved it.\n\nThey loved it so much, that I created a couple of more stories like it. I started to create characters and tell stories about them. And I wrote a comic strip that had a beginning, a middle, and an ending.\n\nI had created a mini-series.\n\nI kept doing this for years.\n\nEventually, I became an editor for a couple of comic strips.\n\nI was also working on a lot of magazine articles. And I had a new job at the campus newspaper. I also had the chance to go to a lot of concerts and I had started to take pictures at them. I began to write reviews of the shows I went to.\n\nIt was at one of these concerts that I met the woman who would eventually become my wife.\n\nAfter the show, we chatted for a while and I gave her my card. She called and asked me to work with her on a magazine project she was working on. I did the artwork for it and she wrote the story.\n\nI moved to Los Angeles.\n\nA couple of years later, we had a child.\n\nShe was a precocious child and she got bored easily.\n\nShe loved puzzles and she loved books.\n\nShe also loved the Guinness Book of Records.\n\nI used to read it to her.\n\nShe loved stories.\n\nShe loved them so much that I started to write her stories. I created a character for her. I called him Grandpa. He was short and fat and he had trouble with the opposite sex.\n\nI wrote a few stories about him. I filled in the details and the gaps. I wrote them like a comic strip. I put in the panels. I filled them with text.\n\nShe liked them.\n\nWe’d sit and read them together. She’d follow along and point at each new panel. She liked the drawings. She liked the story.\n\nBut she wanted more.\n\nShe wanted me to make them into books.\n\nShe wanted me to illustrate them.\n\nSo, I did.\n\nI had a lot of experience in writing comics. And I had just finished a writing project for a friend. So, I started to create some illustrations for the story.\n\nIt took a couple of years, but I did it.\n\nI had created a series of books.\n\nI had also learned something else.\n\nI was also creating a series of books.\n\nSo, what was the difference?\n\nI looked at a lot of comic books and magazine articles. I read a lot of them. I read a lot of magazines and books and I looked at a lot of things that had both pictures and text. And I started to see a pattern.\n\nI also started to see a duplication in things.\n\nFor example, you have a magazine article. It has some text and it has some pictures. There’s a story and the story is told in words. And there are pictures that illustrate the story. The pictures have captions. They explain what the picture is about.\n\nYou then take the article and make it into a book. But what you do is very simple. You take the magazine article and you put it into a book. You add a few words and you put it in a book format.\n\nWhat you’ve really done is to duplicate the magazine article into a book.\n\nYou’ve added words.\n\nYou’ve added the book format.\n\nYou’ve added a cover.\n\nYou’ve added a binding.\n\nYou’ve added a page count.\n\nBut you’ve only changed the way it looks and not what it is.\n\nYou haven’t changed the story.\n\nYou haven’t changed the words.\n\nYou haven’t changed the pictures.\n\nSo, what is
