Release: Audio: Â© Warner Home Video / Cartoon Network Video The menu is the same as before (above) with a grey background. (Lions Gate is the distributor for season 1 on DVD.) The only options are "Play All" and "Episode Selection". English and Spanish subtitles are available. (Yes, the menu is the same as before. However, this is not a Blu-Ray Disc but a regular DVD.)\n\nPicture: The picture is not 16:9 enhanced and is a ratio of 1.33:1. The picture quality varies, but it is decent. However, there are many scenes where the picture is dark, blurred, and has an odd light-shadow pattern. It's not always so noticeable, but it's definitely there. It's actually worse than the first DVD release of season 1. Audio: Audio is Dolby Digital 2.0. It is 2-channel stereo, which is good for TV shows. However, there are several episodes that have a monotonous, low, and slow background sound. This is a downer for me. However, dialogue and music sound fine.\n\nExtras: Unfortunately, there are no extras for this DVD.
