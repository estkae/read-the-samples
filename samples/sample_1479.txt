the history of research into alcohol and public health\n\nThis is the story of our evolution from an era when the consumption of alcoholic beverages was considered a necessary part of everyday life, when consumption of alcohol was defined as the cause of any disorder, and when medical researchers were equated with clergy. It has been estimated that as much as 6.2% of all deaths in England and Wales in 1830 were directly attributable to alcohol. The Lancet reported the fact with alarm, while other medical commentators thought it was more important to look at the figure as an argument in favour of temperance. An early public health specialist, Cuthbert William Johnson (1808-1865), proclaimed, ‘Liquor drinking is therefore the bane of society. There is scarcely any evil which it does not bring with it. It has destroyed families, broken up communities, and debauched whole nations.’ This view was a result of the general attitude of the time that believed that ‘the amount of disease and premature death associated with alcohol was so large as to prevent the realisation of a net benefit to society of the use of alcohol’.1\n\nPublic health as a profession is not that old, and by the middle of the 19th century there were few places in the world where a community health-related practitioner existed. Public health practice began to develop in the mid-19th century, as the incidence of epidemic and endemic disease began to fall and life expectancy began to rise. Advances in science also played a part in the growth of public health, and public health practice benefited from the science of statistics, the germ theory of disease and the concept of causation, along with new concepts such as asepsis and quarantine. These events and ideas became the foundation of public health practice and led to a general change in the perception of alcohol.1\n\nThe role of public health\n\nThe role of public health practice today is to provide leadership in the protection of and promotion of the health of the public. The traditional public health role in relation to alcohol is concerned with providing leadership in the protection of the health of the community from the harms caused by alcohol abuse and in promoting the health and social well-being of individuals and communities.1\n\nThe public health response to alcohol is more extensive and complex today than it has ever been.2 It involves the regulation of the production, distribution, sales, marketing, consumption and consumption consequences of alcoholic beverages; the study of the effect of these alcohol-related actions on the health and well-being of individuals and the community, and the communication of the findings and the results of the actions taken to the general public and to those involved in public policy development. The public health response to alcohol also involves the response of the health profession to alcohol and the research required to provide evidence that can be used to support and develop public policy and practice in the area of alcohol-related harm.\n\nThe concept of alcohol as a drug\n\nBefore the mid-19th century, alcohol was not considered a drug. It was part of everyday life and the consumption of alcohol was defined as the cause of any disorder.1 It is a testament to the role of public health in the development of modern society that by 1900 the consumption of alcohol was no longer defined as a cause of any disorder. It had been transformed from a medicinal agent to a socially maligned drug.\n\nThere is a lesson in the history of research into alcohol and public health. It illustrates how changes in medical understanding of a disorder and the development of public health policy and practice have led to changes in our approach to research and our role in public health.\n\nIf the growth of public health practice is to continue to progress, it is essential that the role of public health research is fully recognised. If we are to remain relevant in the 21st century, we need to fully embrace the opportunities that come with being a public health professional and the part we can play in contributing to the solution of some of the major public health challenges that face our communities and our society today.\n\nUse of the alcohol-related harm scale\n\nWhen alcohol was identified as a cause of harm in the mid-19th century, a systematic method of recording and collecting data on the nature and extent of alcohol-related harm began to develop.1 The scale for recording the extent of alcohol-related harm began as a rough and ready method for describing the nature and extent of the problems related to alcohol use. It is now recognised as a systematic and scientifically robust scale for describing the nature and extent of alcohol-related harm.3\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the World Health Organization (WHO) commissioned a systematic review of the existing studies of alcohol-related harm. A key outcome of this work was the development of the alcohol-related harm scale. The scale was developed to improve the accuracy of alcohol-related harm estimates and to standardise the measurement of the extent of alcohol-related harm within and between studies. It was developed to be used with both general population samples and samples from groups that are specifically at high risk of alcohol-related harm.3 The scale is widely used and the work undertaken in the development of the scale has provided important lessons in the development of scales for measuring alcohol-related harm. These lessons are directly relevant to our research in public health.\n\nThe development of the alcohol-related harm scale\n\nThe alcohol-related harm scale was developed to assist in the measurement of the various aspects of alcohol-related harm. The scale is based on the impact of alcohol on health and social consequences. It is designed to measure the adverse effects of alcohol consumption on the health of individuals, families, communities and societies.3 The scale uses a 4-point categorical scale to rate the severity of alcohol-related harm, which is expressed as follows:\n\n‘(a) the individual is mildly dependent on alcohol or is a heavy drinker with mild problems related to alcohol;\n\n(b) the individual is moderately dependent on alcohol or is a heavy drinker with moderate problems related to alcohol;\n\n(c) the individual is seriously dependent on alcohol or is a heavy drinker with serious problems related to alcohol;\n\n(d) the individual is in a state of complete dependence on alcohol’.3\n\nThis scale is applicable to both general population samples and samples from groups that are at high risk of alcohol-related harm. The scale is also applicable to the estimation of alcohol-related harm in both past and present populations. The data can be compared to other data and trends in alcohol-related harm identified, thus improving the accuracy of estimates of the prevalence of alcohol-related harm in a community or group of people. It has been shown that the alcohol-related harm scale can be used to estimate alcohol-related harm in a wide range of countries and cultures, across the life course, in groups at risk and among the general population.3\n\nThe utility of the alcohol-related harm scale\n\nThe most widely used scale for the measurement of alcohol-related harm is the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT).4 This scale was developed in 1991. It was designed to be administered by non-professional interviewers and consists of 10 questions related to alcohol consumption. It is the most widely used scale in screening people for alcohol-related harm in general population surveys. However, it was not designed to measure the adverse effects of alcohol consumption on health and social consequences. The scale is of particular use in people who are drinking at or below the lower risk drinking levels recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).5 It has been estimated that, because of the AUDIT’s sensitivity to detection of the adverse effects of low levels of consumption of alcohol, the AUDIT may overestimate the level of alcohol-related harm in the population.4\n\nThe alcohol-related harm scale was developed in response to the problem of measurement of the adverse effects of alcohol consumption on health and social consequences.3 The development of the scale was based on a series of detailed and extensive reviews of studies that have measured the impact of alcohol consumption on a range of health, social and economic outcomes.3 The initial evidence of this review was collated in a summary measure of the total effects of alcohol consumption on health and social consequences. It was found that a broad-based measure of the impact of alcohol consumption on health and social consequences was able to significantly improve the predictive power of a wide range of health and social indicators of alcohol-related harm.3 This led to the development of the alcohol-related harm scale.\n\nThe alcohol-related harm scale was developed to help researchers identify the relationship between drinking and a range of health, social and economic outcomes. It has also been designed to improve the comparability of the measurement of alcohol-related harm between studies.3\n\nThe questions in the alcohol-related harm scale were developed on the basis of the evidence of the effects of alcohol consumption on a wide range of health, social and economic outcomes.3 The questions relate to alcohol use that falls within a range of standard consumption levels. The alcohol-related harm scale allows for the measurement of adverse effects of both low-level and high-level consumption of alcohol, and enables both short-term and long-term effects to be measured. The use of the alcohol-related harm scale overcomes the difficulties associated with measuring the impact of both low-level and high-level consumption of alcohol.3\n\nThe usefulness of the alcohol-related harm scale\n\nThe evidence for the usefulness of the alcohol-related harm scale is summarised in Table 1. This includes a number of studies in different countries and cultures, including studies that were conducted in Australia,6-8 Canada,9-11 Ireland,12 New Zealand13 and the United States of America.14\n\nResearch using the alcohol-related harm scale\n\nThe effectiveness of alcohol control policies and programmes can be measured by their impact on the prevalence of alcohol-related
