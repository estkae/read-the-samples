North Fork is a great neighborhood for enjoying Long Island. It is right next to the Merrick and Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressways. You can head south to get to the beaches of Long Island, east for the Hamptons, or head west to enjoy all the city has to offer. This is a great location if you want to be able to spend time in the city or on the island, or both!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
