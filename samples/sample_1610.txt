"A Good Lunch = Our food is made fresh daily with love in the kitchen, and the kitchen is not far from the dining room, so the meal arrives at your table right when it's ready.\n\nThe American Dream = They say it takes hard work to make your dreams come true. It does. But if you want something badly enough, and you're willing to pay the price, the dream will come true.\n\nAn Honest Burger = Our 1/3 lb burgers are made of fresh, all natural beef. We don't stuff them full of processed ingredients, because that's just a cheap gimmick that we refuse to use.
