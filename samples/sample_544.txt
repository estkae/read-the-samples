Josh, p. 20-21:\n\nThe charm of the notes seems to lie in the immediacy with which we can picture him dancing his way through the heady days of the late 1940s, with none of the baggage of fame to muffle his youth, as well as the old man who lived on my street, a retired dentist who probably remembered him, though I never met him. I have the feeling he was quite a prankster and a prankster with a big, booming, gregarious laugh. He clearly loved performing, loved toying with the crowd and, in these days, he had the added advantage of anonymity.
