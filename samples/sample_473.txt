Ahmed Harkat\n\nAhmed Harkat (, ; born April 27, 1971 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) is a Pakistani Canadian and Muslim who was detained as a threat to national security and imprisoned for two years in Canada.\n\nOn May 1, 2005, a Canada-wide arrest warrant was issued for Harkat by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of the United States. On July 18, 2005, Ahmed Harkat was arrested under a Security Certificate by the Government of Canada, at his home in Ottawa, on the grounds that he was involved in terrorist activities, in particular in association with the al-Qaeda organization. On November 23, 2005, Ahmed Harkat was detained indefinitely by the Federal Court. He was released on strict house arrest conditions on February 1, 2006, after the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that his detention was unconstitutional. On December 13, 2007, the Court of Appeal for Ontario found that Harkat was detained lawfully. However, the Court ordered a new detention review hearing to be held before the end of June 2008. The Supreme Court of Canada refused to hear his appeal on February 15, 2008.\n\nHarkat applied for a judicial review of the decision of the Minister of Public Safety to order his detention. The Federal Court of Canada dismissed his application on December 14, 2006. Harkat has appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nThe Federal Court decision came a week after the United States Senate rejected a bill to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.\n\nIn August 2008, Harkat was living under 24-hour house arrest, with some restrictions.\n\nOn June 17, 2009, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the security certificate under which Harkat was detained was valid and that he must be deported.\n\nOn July 29, 2015, the Federal Court of Appeal upheld a lower court decision and ruled that Harkat could stay in Canada. The ruling meant that Harkat could not be removed from Canada and remained under a strict form of house arrest.\n\nOn January 12, 2017, the Supreme Court of Canada refused to hear his appeal.\n\nAhmed Harkat was born in Pakistan in 1971, and he came to Canada in 1995. He speaks some English and has a wife and three daughters. He is a pizza delivery driver in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\n\nHarkat worked in Peshawar, Pakistan as a relief coordinator for Care International Pakistan, an international humanitarian organization, until 1999. He then went on to work as an accountant and cashier at Afghan Relief in Peshawar, a project of the National Council for Voluntary Social Services (NCVSS).\n\nHarkat came to the attention of Canadian intelligence officials after being deported from Dubai in April 2000, after he failed to obtain a visa for the United States. He has never visited Afghanistan, a key requirement of a security certificate. Harkat also states that he was not involved in any terrorist activity, and has never supported or associated with a terrorist organization.\n\nHarkat was arrested on December 10, 2002. He was charged with knowingly facilitating a terrorist activity and knowingly participating in the activities of a terrorist group.\n\nOn January 23, 2003, a judge granted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) an order to monitor his activities and to search his home. On March 20, 2003, Harkat was released under a strict curfew. The surveillance and house arrest was lifted on September 11, 2003.\n\nOn February 10, 2004, the judge in the case ruled that Harkat would not be allowed to work as a relief coordinator in his community or to interact with a list of specified persons, including the media. On March 10, 2004, Harkat's curfew was changed from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m., and the list of people he was not allowed to contact was expanded to include more than 100 people, including several Members of Parliament.\n\nOn May 11, 2004, the judge in the case ruled that Harkat would not be allowed to attend community events, and that he would be required to meet regularly with RCMP officials.\n\nOn August 16, 2004, Harkat was accused of writing love letters to two married women, one of whom was an RCMP officer.\n\nOn September 15, 2004, the Attorney General of Canada, under Paul Martin, asked that Harkat be detained for an additional six months, which was approved by a judge on October 12.\n\nOn September 30, 2004, Harkat's wife, Sophie, appeared on a news show, the "National Magazine" on CBC.\n\nOn January 21, 2005, the Federal Court of Canada ordered Harkat to remain under a 24-hour surveillance and under house arrest. On January 23, 2005, he was required to surrender his passport.\n\nOn May 1, 2005, a Canada-wide arrest warrant was issued by the FBI for Hark"
