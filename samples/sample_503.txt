Public Works reports it was a busy day with well over 50 customers reporting issues with their service. The county was very busy all day responding to reported issues, working to clear downed trees, and repairing road damage.\n\nBelow are some pictures from this morning of some of the damage caused by this storm.\n\n\n\nOne of the downed trees on Lakeshore Road.\n\nPictured here is the removal of a large tree on Lakeshore Road.\n\nAnother downed tree on Lakeshore Road\n\nMore trees down on Lakeshore Road\n\nDebris on Lakeshore Road.\n\nTree down on Lewis Street.
