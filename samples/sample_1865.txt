Author: Jessica\n\nWritten: December 18th, 2012\n\nA few months ago I had a huge bunch of Kale arrive in my garden, so I decided to try a bunch of recipes with it! This one turned out to be my favorite. It’s super simple, doesn’t require any cooking, and tastes great! So I figured I’d share the recipe! I didn’t have any nuts, but walnuts would be great to use in this.\n\nKale Salad\n\n1 bunch Kale (washed, and dried well)\n\n1 T Olive Oil\n\n3 T Orange Juice\n\n2 T Apple Cider Vinegar\n\n1 T Lemon"
