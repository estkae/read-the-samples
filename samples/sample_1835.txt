"Local craft beer made just for women to hit Manitoba's shelves\n\nTHUNDER BAY – The Great North Aleworks on George Street West will be releasing a beer for women in March.\n\nThat beer will be produced in response to requests from local women who tried out their flagship North Star Session Ale.\n\n“We had a number of women come to our brewery and want to try a beer that they can relate to,” says the owner of the brewery Mike McIsaac. “We wanted to provide them with something that they’re going to enjoy and that’s how the whole thing came about.”\n\nThe beer will be a Belgian White and will be the same as the North Star but with added flavours and aromas that women enjoy.\n\nMcIsaac says the response to the beer has been positive and women have come to the brewery to try out the product and are generally enjoying it.\n\n“There’s a number of breweries across the country who have come out with beers that cater to the female palate,” says McIsaac. “A lot of the beers have fruit notes and a lighter body and more sessionable.”\n\nThe Great North Aleworks is still working out the exact release date for the beer and McIsaac says it will likely be on the shelves sometime in March.
