Rössler attractor\n\nThe Rössler attractor (or Rössler system, named after Heinz-Otto Rössler) is a chaotic attractor found in systems governed by a nonlinear difference equation. The Rössler attractor is typically used to model chaotic motion in biological and physical systems.\n\nThe Rössler attractor was the first chaotic attractor ever to be discovered. Its existence was first suspected in 1963 by David Ruelle, who was studying differential equations of the form formula_1. He soon began to suspect that certain equations of this form were capable of generating chaotic behaviour. It was Rössler, however, who first proved that this was indeed the case.\n\nAn example of a simple equation of this form, in which the nonlinearity is the derivative, is\n\nIn the case of formula_3, this equation has the solution\n\nwhich clearly exhibits chaotic behaviour. For certain values of formula_5 and formula_6, however, the solution can exhibit regular behaviour, as illustrated below. The precise values that cause this to occur depend on the parameters of the equation.\n\nFor these values of formula_5 and formula_6, the solution takes the form\n\nformula_9\n\nformula_10\n\nformula_11\n\nThis solution repeats itself in a periodic manner, meaning that in this case the attractor is a period attractor. As the formula_5 and formula_6 parameters vary, the solution's behaviour can change from periodic to chaotic.\n\nThere are many methods available for computing the Rössler attractor. The first of these methods, and the most straightforward, is an algorithm that was proposed by H.O. Rössler in the original paper in which the attractor was described. This algorithm essentially consists of an algorithm for computing the vector field for the differential equation, followed by an algorithm for drawing the curves in the resulting vector field.\n\nGiven a differential equation of the form\n\nformula_15\n\nformula_16\n\nformula_17\n\nthen the equation has a unique solution in the vector field formula_18 of the form\n\nformula_19\n\nwhere formula_20 is the Kronecker delta function.\n\nThe Rössler algorithm for the vector field is as follows:\n\nIf the resulting vector field has dimension formula_22, then it is a point in a formula_22-dimensional space. Therefore, in this case, the attractor is a formula_22-dimensional space.\n\nIf the resulting vector field has dimension less than formula_22, then the algorithm can be repeated, as described below.\n\nGiven the vector field formula_26, the Rössler algorithm for the curve is as follows:\n\nGiven an initial point formula_30, the first step of this algorithm finds the vector formula_31 that has the minimum value in the space defined by the vector field formula_18.\n\nIn the case of the example given above, the vector field has dimension formula_22. Therefore, there are formula_22 vectors that can be used as initial points.\n\nLet formula_35 be an initial point. Then the curve defined by the vector formula_31 is called the Rössler curve.\n\nThe example above shows the result of using an initial point that is formula_37. The corresponding Rössler curve is illustrated below.\n\nAs the vector formula_31 varies, the Rössler curve traces out a line. For certain values of formula_31, the curve traces out a line that contains a great deal of structure.\n\nFor formula_31 values in which the curve traces out a line that does not have a great deal of structure, the Rössler algorithm can be repeated. The algorithm can be repeated as many times as necessary to produce a curve that contains the desired structure.\n\nThe Rössler algorithm has been implemented by many authors in a variety of software packages.\n\nThere are a variety of methods available for computing the attractor itself. The simplest of these methods involves repeating the procedure for computing the vector field. The attractor consists of the curve traced out by the point formula_31 in the vector field formula_18.\n\nGiven a vector field formula_18, a point formula_31, and a time formula_46, then the attractor at time formula_46 is the curve traced out by formula_31 in the vector field formula_18.\n\nGiven a system of differential equations of the form\n\nformula_51\n\nformula_52\n\nformula_53\n\nthe attractor of this system is the Rössler attractor formula_54.\n\nGiven a vector field formula_18, a point formula_31, and a time formula_46, then the attractor at time formula_46 is the curve traced out by formula_31 in the vector field formula_18.\n\nGiven a set of parameter values, the attractor can be computed by iterating this procedure for a sufficient number of time steps.\n\nThere are a variety of methods available for computing the attractor itself.
