"While some species are recognized as a single unit, they often consist of several distinct groups that have a common characteristic," Davis said. "In this case, the characteristic is the presence of this particular steroid in all the species we looked at. If this steroid is a unique identifier for the group, we wanted to know if the species that contain it are closely related. We discovered that some species that produce the steroid are more closely related than others, and this pattern fits with our prediction that the ecological function of the steroid might be to keep different species from competing with one another for food."
