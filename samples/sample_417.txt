"Jonathan Chait at New York Magazine says we should start ignoring Donald Trump.\n\nTrump gets endless media coverage, which he then uses to insist he should be treated fairly by the media.\n\nThe fact that Trump is now president makes his demand for fair coverage a valid concern. So Chait’s right that ignoring Trump isn’t the solution.\n\nBut Chait is also wrong that Trump doesn’t deserve any media coverage. He’s just like any other president.\n\nJust not as good at it.\n\nChait notes that Trump uses the press to get out his message:\n\nThe president of the United States is an extremely powerful figure. Even if the entire country agrees that the president of the United States is, in fact, a buffoon who speaks only in unintelligible gibberish, the president of the United States is still very powerful.\n\nChait is correct. Trump may have been a complete loser in the private sector. But in politics, Trump’s clearly been a winner.\n\nThere are many reasons Trump has been a success in politics. Some of these reasons have to do with his political positions. But most of the reasons have to do with his personality.\n\nTrump is the ultimate salesman. He is a chameleon, able to change his tone and style to appeal to his audience. He’s also the consummate bullshit artist, able to make false promises sound plausible.\n\nAnd Trump’s made one of his signature moves since he began his political career. He completely ignores his Democratic opponents and talks directly to his voters. He’s smart enough to understand that his opponents aren’t really interested in actually talking to him.\n\nTrump has always understood how to get his message out, even if the message isn’t all that important. It’s why he never had a detailed health care plan. He wanted to talk to people who agreed with him about how terrible Obamacare was.\n\nHe’s never really been interested in a detailed plan. He’s interested in getting media coverage, because he knows the media will talk about what he says.\n\nTrump is constantly in search of free media coverage. The media gave him endless coverage during the campaign, and he won. And they’re giving him endless coverage now, and he’s still president.\n\nThe problem is that Trump is terrible at getting his message out in an organized and coherent way. He’s also terrible at actually getting anything done.\n\nTrump’s behavior is extremely damaging. But the damage doesn’t come from the fact that he’s in the news. It comes from the fact that he’s so terrible at what he does.\n\nPeople who work for him never know what’s going to come out of his mouth. And they’re never really sure what he’s going to do.\n\nBut his supporters always know where Trump stands. He’s going to get rid of illegal immigrants. He’s going to bring back jobs from overseas. He’s going to put coal miners back to work.\n\nThat’s the message he has for his supporters. And they know that even if his administration doesn’t do what he says, Trump is still fighting for them.\n\nAll presidents have to use the media to get their message out. The difference with Trump is that his message is essentially nonexistent.\n\nTrump isn’t president because he has an interesting policy agenda. He’s president because he knows how to use the media to his advantage.\n\nThat means that we have to talk about him, whether we want to or not.
