Provenance\n\nThrough MFA gift, 1925\n\nThis identification is uncertain as the work was not catalogued in the exhibition that took place in 1925. In order to avoid listing it twice, we have chosen to omit it from the record. It is, however, a plausible assumption given the prevalence of landscape imagery among English artists at this time.\n\n
