Wicca covens are sometimes known as 'sisterhoods', 'sister circles', 'sister groups', 'covens' or 'circles', and may consist of a handful of members or hundreds, as the situation warrants. These groups of Wiccan witches are organized to achieve a common purpose, which may include the following.\n\n- learning and practicing magic\n\n- celebrating the eight Wiccan festivals\n\n- assisting a member in need\n\n- celebrating the Sabbats\n\n- performing a spell or ritual for a friend, relative, or member of the coven\n\nThe Wiccan coven consists of a High Priestess, a High Priest, and their trainees. The coven members worship the God and Goddess through their rituals, ceremonies, and festivals. They see these as expressions of the sacred power of the Universe.\n\nWiccan covens operate as autonomous spiritual groups with each coven under the leadership of a High Priestess and High Priest, who are usually the leaders of the coven. It is usually up to the covens to determine their structure, rules, and size.\n\nWithin a coven, there may be two or more leaders. However, the High Priestess is generally the senior leader and it is she who sets the policies, rules, and rituals of the coven. She also has the final say in any decision that may need to be made.
