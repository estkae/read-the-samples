"About 75 people attended the open house, at which planners showed maps and photographs of the proposed route and gave a series of short presentations. The maps and the idea for a cycle route to Las Vegas came about through community meetings over the last year, including public meetings in November and May.\n\n\n\nThere are three open houses this month in the wake of a March 5 community advisory committee meeting in which planners identified six possible routes between the two towns.\n\n\n\nThe final route chosen at that meeting was called the southern route, also known as the ranch route. It runs primarily along Route 15, turning east along Box Canyon Road and taking Route 44 west into Las Vegas.\n\n\n\nThe southern route passes through Springtown and Bullard’s Crossing, a subdivision that has only one entrance and exit on the east side of town.\n\n\n\nThe southern route was given a higher priority than the other five routes based on a scoring system that took into account scenic value, viewshed, population and resources affected.\n\n\n\nDuring the March 5 meeting, most of the traffic and resource concerns came from residents of Bullard’s Crossing, a subdivision located about a mile east of the highway. Residents expressed concerns about traffic and safety if the route goes through Bullard’s Crossing, and about passing cyclists causing dust and a lower quality of life.\n\n\n\nThe concerns were addressed during the open house. Project manager Dennis Peacock explained that while a good deal of development had occurred in the past 10 to 15 years, the majority of it was not residential.\n\n\n\nHe said a wide range of ages live in the development, including young families and some older people. He also said people’s vision for Bullard’s Crossing could be different.\n\n\n\nHe said that no more than 25 percent of the vehicles on Box Canyon Road were bicyclists. Peacock also said there are three turn-outs on the road for cyclists to rest.\n\n\n\nHe also pointed out that the path would be nearly 200 feet wide, and that it would be a two-lane paved road.\n\n\n\n“It’s not like we are planning to put a bike path down Main Street in town,” Peacock said.\n\n\n\nResident Tim Johnson said the development and new path would not be mutually exclusive.\n\n\n\n“It would be wonderful to have a development plan for Bullard’s Crossing,” he said. “We want to get along with everyone. It is nice to see what it is going to be.”\n\n\n\nPeacock also said that if the development project did not go through, the path would be moved further north.\n\n\n\nAnother question brought up at the meeting was how cyclists would get to the path in the first place. Peacock said that by the end of 2009, the state was going to convert a portion of Box Canyon Road into an interstate.\n\n\n\n“That is what will get cyclists to Las Vegas,” he said.\n\n\n\nIt was also noted at the meeting that a rider in the Tour de France, after finishing the race, could have been home in Springtown within the same time it took him to finish the race.\n\n\n\nOne of the questions that had not been answered at the community advisory committee meeting was whether the route would be designated as a state or federal highway. Peacock said during the open house that the route would be considered a state highway.\n\n\n\n“The path will be open to any user as long as they have a vehicle that has been registered with the state of Nevada,” Peacock said.\n\n\n\nAccording to the planning maps, the path would pass by the Spring Valley and Bullard’s Crossing reservoirs, two popular fishing and boating spots for Springtown and Bullard’s Crossing residents.\n\n\n\nPeacock said there were provisions for “get out of the way” ramps for fishermen. The route would also pass over the top of them, taking the route over land, and not through the reservoir.\n\n\n\nThere was also a question about cyclists using the path at night. Peacock said that the project had received funding to put LED lighting down the entire route.\n\n\n\n“You will be able to ride that at night,” he said.\n\n\n\nThe route has been designed to accommodate a commuter, recreational, equestrian and bicycle tourism user.\n\n\n\nThe next community meeting is planned for April 1 in Las Vegas.
