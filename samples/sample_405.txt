"Hillary Clinton was a no-show at the opening of a new museum dedicated to women's history and equality in New York City on Tuesday, a day after she cancelled campaign events because of a stomach virus that left her dehydrated and dizzy.\n\nClinton's Republican opponent Donald Trump and his wife Melania did not attend the high-profile opening either.\n\nClinton's doctor said in a statement Monday that the Democratic presidential candidate had been "diagnosed with pneumonia" on Friday.\n\nThe museum is dedicated to women's history and feminist causes. Clinton's ties with the National Museum of Women in the Arts go back many years.\n\nShe presented the museum's founding patron, Mercedes T. Bass, with a leadership award in 2009. The museum's chair, Susan Henshaw Jones, has been a top Clinton donor.\n\nA spokesman for Clinton said on Monday that the former secretary of state "continues to feel better," but he didn't indicate when she would resume campaigning.\n\nCampaign spokesman Nick Merrill said the Democratic presidential nominee has had an allergy-related cough, and that "several hours of sleep" and some antihistamines helped.\n\nThe illness struck just after Clinton flew back to New York City from a weekend trip to California.\n\nOn Monday, her doctor Lisa R. Bardack said in a statement that Clinton had had an examination of her pneumonia in a chest CT scan.\n\nBardack said the Democratic nominee "is recovering nicely" and has been "advised to rest and modify her schedule" as she continues to recuperate.\n\nClinton abruptly left a 9/11 anniversary ceremony Sunday in New York City after feeling overheated, according to her campaign. She retreated to her daughter's nearby apartment, but later emerged and told reporters: "I'm feeling great. It's a beautiful day in New York."\n\nShe left Sunday's event at Ground Zero shortly after she arrived. Her campaign said she felt "overheated" and departed for her daughter's apartment in New York's Flatiron neighborhood.\n\nVideo captured by a bystander showed Clinton apparently struggle to get into a vehicle as staff members held her up by the arms.\n\nClinton, 68, did not immediately disclose the pneumonia diagnosis. Her aides initially said she had overheated.\n\nBardack said Clinton is "re-hydrated and recovering nicely" after attending a 9/11 anniversary event Sunday.\n\nThe health issue was not mentioned at a fundraising event Monday in Manhattan for Democratic Senate candidate Ted Strickland of Ohio, according to participants.\n\nAsked if the candidate's health was a campaign issue, spokesman Jesse Ferguson said, "No."\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jonathan Lemire in New York and Ken Thomas in Washington contributed to this report.
