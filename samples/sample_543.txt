LAKELAND, Fla. -- Jason Vargas understands he won't be pitching every fifth day like he has in the past, and he knows he might not get to pitch the way he'd like to, but the 33-year-old left-hander said he's "excited" for the opportunity to make the Detroit Tigers' starting rotation.\n\n"It's a unique opportunity," Vargas said Sunday, when he was officially added to the Tigers' 25-man roster. "You don't see many pitchers make that transition back into the rotation, and I've made it a lot of times before, so I'm excited to be back in that role."\n\nThe Tigers announced Vargas' move before a 1-0, 12-inning victory over the Baltimore Orioles at Joker Marchant Stadium. After striking out six in five innings, Vargas was credited with the win.\n\nWith the addition of Vargas, Detroit's pitching staff stands at 14 pitchers. He joins Michael Fulmer, Jordan Zimmermann, Daniel Norris, Matt Boyd and Anibal Sanchez as the group of starters.\n\n"It's definitely a big adjustment," said Vargas, who has a 1-0 record and 5.91 ERA in four appearances with the Tigers this spring. "You can't be as aggressive as you were in the past. But you kind of have to pick and choose your battles.\n\n"You don't want to leave too many pitches up in the zone. You have to throw some early strikes, and you just have to be smart."\n\nManager Brad Ausmus said Vargas "has handled it well" this spring.\n\n"He's looked like he's handled it pretty well," Ausmus said. "And he has."\n\nVargas, who signed a minor-league contract with the Tigers in January, made 27 starts last season for the Kansas City Royals. He went 4-10 with a 5.26 ERA in his final season with the Royals. He said he will continue to mix and match between the rotation and the bullpen.\n\n"He fits our roster well," Ausmus said. "I think that he can come out of the bullpen and start."\n\nVargas said he's willing to do what the Tigers want him to do, but he wants to make it clear that he will continue to pursue the opportunity to start.\n\n"If they want me to start, that's fine," he said. "If they want me to come out of the bullpen, that's fine. But my goal is to start and to get back in there and pitch like I know I can pitch."\n\n-- Download the Detroit Tigers on MLive app for iPhone and Android.\n\n-- Follow MLive Sports on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
