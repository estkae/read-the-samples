"Until now, one of the major downsides to Ubuntu Touch has been the lack of support for LTE connections. Most of us are used to working on Wi-Fi, but being able to switch to mobile data is a huge advantage. If you need to download large files, it’s a lot quicker and more convenient to do so on 4G than it is on a Wi-Fi network.\n\nBut, as of the Ubuntu 14.04.3 release, Canonical has announced that the mobile network support is now working for all supported phones, both the Nexus 4 and the Nexus 7 2013, but it’s still not turned on by default. That’s why it’s important to know how to turn it on.\n\nThe Mobile Data option is hidden deep inside the settings menu. To get there, you’ll need to navigate to Settings > Connectivity > Mobile Networks. You’ll notice that there are two sections in this menu, one for Data Roaming, and one for Enable LTE. In both sections, simply select the tick box next to Enable and you’re good to go.\n\nUbuntu Touch is still in the very early stages of development, but the fact that we’re getting these kind of features now means that the platform will get better and better with every update. I’m definitely glad to see that I won’t have to rely on Wi-Fi in the future to get online.
