However, the player's prospects for this year's World Cup appear to have been significantly damaged.\n\nOwen's injury is a crushing blow for England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson, who had been relying on him to lead his attack in Germany.\n\nOwen underwent surgery at Manchester's Cromwell Hospital on Wednesday night. He will be released from hospital tomorrow.\n\nOwen had complained of stiffness in his right knee and the first signs of damage were revealed in a scan on Thursday.\n\nThe 24-year-old, who has not played for England since the friendly against Sweden in November, was in the final stages of preparations to face Holland at Old Trafford on February 7 and Australia three days later.\n\n"I'd say it's a minimum of six weeks," said the national team's physio Gary Lewin.\n\n"It's a bad injury and he's got a lot of scar tissue in the joint, which will take a while to repair."\n\nOwen's absence from the two friendlies will cast doubts over his readiness for the World Cup.\n"
