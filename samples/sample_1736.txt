By\n\nQuestion: How much can I deduct for travel expenses while on business?\n\nAnswer: The IRS lets you deduct travel expenses if you work away from your home on a temporary assignment. These expenses include the cost of transportation, meals and lodging while away from home overnight.\n\nWhile on a business trip, you can deduct the cost of lodging (including hotels, motels, and resorts) if it is reasonable and you pay for it yourself.\n\nIf you travel for the employer, the employer will pay for your lodging. But to deduct the lodging expense, the lodging must meet the IRS definition of a “taxable fringe benefit.” The tax law gives special treatment to employer-paid lodging in an employee’s home city or town or in another area where the employer requires the employee to sleep. But the employer-paid lodging does not qualify as a “taxable fringe benefit” if it is for lodging outside these areas, even if the employee must sleep in the lodging.\n\nHowever, if the employee stays in a hotel, motel, or resort while working at a temporary job location away from home, the IRS will allow you to deduct travel expenses as a business deduction. You can deduct travel expenses even if you pay them with money the employer gave you.\n\nTravel expenses that you deduct for work-related travel away from home are also subject to the 2% limit on miscellaneous itemized deductions. So be sure to keep all your receipts and records.\n\nWe’re here to help you.\n\nCall us today at (702) 468-4444. We are located at 9333 W. Sahara Ave, Ste 200, Las Vegas, NV 89117.
