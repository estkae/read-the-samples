"\n\nToday we’re excited to announce that Bethesda Game Studios has joined Oculus as a developer for the Oculus Rift. The partnership will see the creation of two exclusive, made-for-VR games from Bethesda Game Studios; the first is currently being designed for virtual reality and the second is being built for traditional monitors.\n\n\n\n“At Oculus, we’re dedicated to helping developers and partners to grow, and the support and dedication we’ve received from Bethesda Game Studios has been outstanding,” said Brendan Iribe, CEO of Oculus. “John Carmack, founder of id Software and now CTO at Oculus, believes in our vision and has created a custom version of Doom 3 BFG Edition for Oculus. We look forward to continuing to work with Bethesda as we develop our first generation of virtual reality games and experiences.”\n\n\n\n“I have a lot of personal interest in making sure that the VR gaming space is successful because I really believe in the technology and its potential to change gaming,” said Carmack. “As a developer, the Rift is something that I’ve wanted to work with for a long time, but the existing technology wasn’t quite there yet. I’m happy to be able to help to make the Rift a success and contribute to the rebirth of VR gaming.”\n\n\n\nAt Bethesda Game Studios, developers are working on a number of unannounced projects including new entries in major franchises. Those who have seen this year’s E3 show floor, Gamescom or Quakecon presentations have seen teases of what the studio is up to and a few of the titles we have in development are also being designed for virtual reality. The two games announced today are entirely new IP and we can’t wait to show them to you when they’re ready for primetime.\n\n\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with Bethesda Game Studios, the acclaimed developer is responsible for creating many of the industry’s most popular games including the “Elder Scrolls” series, the single-player add-on to the original “Doom” and the “Fallout” series. In fact, “Fallout 3,” “Fallout: New Vegas” and “The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim” were each awarded game of the year at the 2008, 2010 and 2011 BAFTA awards, respectively.\n\n\n\n“We have made some long-term technology investments with VR in mind,” said Todd Howard, Game Director and Executive Producer at Bethesda Game Studios. “Hardware is finally catching up to the visions developers have had for virtual reality. Now when you put on a VR headset, you’re transported to new and amazing worlds.”\n\n\n\nThis year, Bethesda Game Studios showcased “Doom 3 BFG Edition” for Oculus. “Doom 3 BFG Edition” is a complete overhaul of “Doom 3” that brings modern technology and a classic, storied franchise into the world of virtual reality. This is the first title designed for virtual reality.\n\n\n\n“John Carmack’s work in the early 90s helped usher in the era of modern 3D gaming, and his genius continues to inspire developers to innovate,” said Brendan Iribe, CEO of Oculus. “The team at Bethesda Game Studios is made up of the most talented developers in the industry and we can’t wait to bring their newest games, made for virtual reality, to life.”\n\n\n\nOver the past 20 years, Bethesda Game Studios has earned its reputation as one of the industry’s most respected and accomplished game development studios. Creators of the 2006 and 2008 Game of the Year, “The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion” and 2010 Game of the Year, “The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,” Bethesda Game Studios has earned a reputation for excellence and quality with each of its five releases.\n\n\n\nThis partnership is another step toward realizing the future of virtual reality. It’s an exciting time to be a gamer with the release of these groundbreaking VR titles, the arrival of next generation consoles and the continued evolution of the PC.\n\n\n\nStay tuned for more news on Bethesda Game Studios’ titles for Oculus.\n\n\n\n– The Oculus Team
