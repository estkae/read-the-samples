"As the fashion world is taking notice of Athleisure (a new style trend of casual attire that incorporates sports-luxe style elements), a new video called The Slits, from G. Garvin (a C-level marketing executive), perfectly illustrates why we love this trend. The video features an athleisure-clad woman who uses the sporty-swag inspired outfit to complete a variety of day-to-day tasks in style.\n\nThe music to the video is performed by Miley Cyrus and written by Cyrus and Pharrell Williams. The music video is part of a larger promotion for the G. Garvin brand.
