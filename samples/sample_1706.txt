Nah.\n\n\n\nOnly reasons it would be a decent primary would be it's size (shorter barrel) and it's concealability. I can hide it better than either of my pistols. It's only because of my own physical stature and size that it would be easy to carry. I'm not one of those people that are slender with low body fat and don't really have much of a shape to their body. I'm just a skinny dude.\n\n\n\nLike I said though, it's not a bad gun. Just no where near worth the asking price. My RIA runs great, has perfect trigger, and feels great. I love shooting that gun.\n\n\n\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v3...t/IMG_0078.jpg\n\n\n\nIf I could get an RIA/STI that felt the same way and was the same size, it would be my choice for CCW. Maybe after I finish saving up for a S&W MP9, I will look into something like this.\n\n\n\nAll that being said, my advice for anyone that wants to purchase one of these would be to hold off until they release the tactical variant. I have never owned a STI, so I cannot speak for their quality or how well it would shoot. However, if you want to pay for it, then go ahead. I don't know what you want to do with it, but for CCW, would I carry it? No. Not even a little bit. It's too big.I would be happy to have it as a back up for my RIA 38sp and my M&P 40, but as a primary CCW?
