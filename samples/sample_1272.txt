"Injustice 2 DLC Characters Will Include Both Original Version And New One\n\nby Stephen Stewart - 6 months ago\n\nWe’ve been telling you that Injustice 2‘s DLC characters are going to be a big deal, and that’s because each and every one of them will get two versions of their own – a standard version, and a “Premiere Skins” version that’ll include premium gear.\n\nWhile we don’t know who the DLC characters are yet, NetherRealm Creative Director Ed Boon just confirmed on Twitter that both the standard and Premiere Skins versions will be released when the character’s DLC drops.\n\nIt looks like that’s a change from the original Mortal Kombat X method of releasing skins, where only the Premiere Skins version was released.\n\nAre you excited to see what the Injustice 2 DLC characters will be like?
