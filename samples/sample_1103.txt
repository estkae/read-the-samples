With the general availability of Windows 10, we’ve seen a lot of changes to Microsoft’s flagship operating system. One of those changes is the Start menu. It was a big change, but not all of the changes were met with open arms. For those of us who are fans of Classic Shell, this is something we have to deal with. This tutorial shows you how to remove the OneDrive placeholder from the Windows 10 Start menu.\n\nPlease note that this tutorial will be using a desktop method, but the start menu itself will be the same.\n\nRemove OneDrive from the Windows 10 Start menu\n\nLet’s get started by creating a new folder in our start menu. Click on the Start button and select “All Apps”. This should open up your start menu and display all of your installed programs. Scroll down to the bottom and right-click in an empty space. This should bring up a context menu with an option to create a new folder. Select that option. You should now see the folder.\n\nWe are going to be renaming the folder to make it easier to identify. Click on the name and rename it to “OneDrive”. Right click the folder and select “Properties”. In the properties dialog, select the “Customize” option. This will bring up a dialog box. Select “Clear” to remove the placeholder text.\n\nThat’s it. Once you do that, your OneDrive placeholder should be removed. If you don’t like it that way, you can always re-enable it. I know there are some people who do like the placeholder, but if you’re not using it, why have it there?\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER
