"Harlan Coben is back on top form. This time around he introduces us to David Gifford, an architect who just wants to build a library in the small town of Lawrenceville. But as the project starts to gain more momentum and publicity, the people who oppose the building are slowly dying, one by one.\n\n\n\nDavid is not your average hero, in fact he’s a bit of an anti-hero. He’s weak, a little cowardly, a smoker, a drinker and not the best looking guy around, but what he lacks in manliness, he more than makes up for in wit and cunning. This is a man who, if he can avoid being killed himself, has a very bright future as a private investigator, and that’s not to say that he doesn’t take risks. He’s a very brave man, but more through luck than any kind of action plan.\n\n\n\nWe’re not talking about a particularly high concept plot here, and Coben does a great job of making us think we know what’s going on, and then throwing us a curveball. He’s so good at this that even when we get to the last page of the book we’re still convinced that we’ve got it all wrong, and we want to read the book again.\n\n\n\nThe story has more than its fair share of twists and turns, and the resolution comes as a surprise, even though we should see it coming a mile off. This is a novel that doesn’t quite hold up to close scrutiny, but Coben puts together a very entertaining piece of writing, and gives the reader everything they need to be entertained. That’s a very rare thing in today’s publishing climate, and it’s not to be missed.\n\n\n\nThe Innocent is a real return to form for Coben, and if you haven’t read his novels in a while, this is a great place to start.\n\n\n\n
