"I had a wonderful stay at Casa Para, and canâ€™t wait to go back! Not only was it a beautiful place with an awesome view, the staff is amazing. The hosts were incredibly accommodating, with good communication from the time of booking to arriving in the house. The house was very clean and organized, with all the amenities one could need and more! The area was wonderful and we were able to get to the nearby town of San Marcos in 10 minutes, and it was a really lovely town to explore! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!
