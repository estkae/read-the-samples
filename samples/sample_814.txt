Epstein-Barr virus is a common virus that infects people worldwide. In most people it causes no symptoms or illness.\n\nIn a small number of people the virus will remain in their body and in some cases go on to cause chronic symptoms and illnesses, including lymphoma and other cancers.\n\nTo be at increased risk of these illnesses you must have the virus for a long period of time, usually many years. You are also more at risk if you are immunosuppressed.\n\nIt is not clear exactly what causes the virus to remain in the body for so long. It may be related to the size of the dose that a person receives.\n\nSome research shows that the virus tends to persist in those people who have particular types of EBV-specific antibodies.
