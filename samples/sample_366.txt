In California, a convicted pedophile is on the loose. The worst part? He's a convicted pedophile.\n\nFrancisco Felix-Jimenez was released from prison last week. He was convicted of molesting an 8-year-old boy in 2006.\n\nWell, it turns out that the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department forgot to register Felix-Jimenez as a sex offender.\n\nYou may be asking yourself, "How does that happen?"\n\nThey may have simply forgot. It happens all the time, although it's usually because a sheriff's department employee who should have registered the convicted sex offender doesn't think the guy will do it again.\n\nSometimes a new chief or sheriff takes over the department, doesn't like the policy, and cancels the sex offender registry.\n\nHere's another scenario: When the convicted sex offender is released from prison, he is given a deadline by the parole board to register.\n\nIf the parole board gives the guy a year, the sheriff's department is probably going to give him a year.\n\nHowever, if the parole board gives the guy a year and the county sheriff wants him off the street, he will register the convicted sex offender that day.\n\nIn the case of Felix-Jimenez, the sex offender registry is mandatory and the deadline wasn't up yet, so how he is able to be on the loose is still unclear.\n\nThe good news is that Felix-Jimenez hasn't gone into hiding.\n\nIn fact, the most recent report shows that he is staying in a homeless shelter in Van Nuys.\n\nCalifornia doesn't want him there.
