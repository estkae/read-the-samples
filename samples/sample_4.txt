Aulus Atilius Calatinus\n\nAulus Atilius Calatinus was consul of the Roman Republic in 221 BC with Gaius Claudius Nero. The primary action of the consulship was the siege and capture of the Volscian city of Suessa Pometia.\n\nIn the same year he was sent to Tarentum with a fleet of 10,000 infantry and 800 cavalry to aid the Tarentines in the Second War with the Bruttians. Calatinus was captured in a naval action off the coast near Tarentum, and the Bruttian admiral Lucerius was rewarded with his command for this victory. The Roman troops under his command, however, escaped to Thurii.\n\nThe earlier Aulus Atilius Calatinus was elected consul in 222 BC, and killed in a battle with the Samnites.\n\n
