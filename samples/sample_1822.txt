European Athletic Association (European Athletics) (stylized as EUROPEAN ATHLETIC or europa.athletics) is the governing body for athletics, track cycling, and race walking in Europe.[1] It is one of the six Area Associations of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). European Athletics has 51 member federations divided into seven area associations.[2]\n\nContents History 1\n\nCompetition rules 2\n\nAthletes 3\n\nAthletics Team 4\n\nControversy 5\n\nSee also 6\n\nReferences 7\n\nExternal links 8\n\nHistory\n\nEuropean Athletics is responsible for the organisation and management of European Championship and the annual European Team Championships, held since 1964. In addition, the organisation holds two annual meetings: the European Athletics Convention, a forum for the European athletics community, and the European Athletics Annual General Meeting, where the budget and activities for the upcoming season are decided upon. It also has two age group meetings (the European Junior Championships and the European Youth Championships) which are used for the development of the sport, the qualification for and entry into other competitions.\n\nThe first major competition organised by European Athletics was the European Athletics Championships, first held in 1934. This meeting was held in Turin, Italy and was won by Finland.\n\nCompetition rules\n\nEuropean Athletics runs the annual European Team Championships, first held in Stockholm, Sweden in 1966, the year after the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) recognised it as the continental association for Europe. Each year the organisation holds a number of competitions which athletes gain points for their team for. The biggest event is the European Athletics Championships, first held in 1934, and also known as the European Championships (after the IAAF started a separate event in 1990). This meeting is held two years prior to the Olympic Games, and incorporates competitions in athletics, the IAAF World Race Walking Cup and the European Cross Country Championships. The only annual competition between European Athletics and the IAAF World Championships in Athletics is the European Team Championships.\n\nThe European Team Championships was held 22 times, first in 1966 and most recently in 2013. Since 2010 the European Team Championships and the IAAF World Championships in Athletics are organised in the same year, held in the same stadium.\n\nAthletes\n\nSome of the most successful athletics countries are:\n\nAthletics Team\n\nControversy\n\nThe appointment of Svein Arne Hansen as President of the European Athletics is seen by many as contentious, as his country Norway has fewer than 100 members of European Athletics, and would therefore have little say in the governance of the organisation.[3]\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\n^"
