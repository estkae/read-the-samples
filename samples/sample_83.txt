As a police chief, I hold myself and my command staff to the highest standard. I expect my officers to be role models and to demonstrate professionalism and respect. We have a lot of hard working men and women in the St. Charles Police Department and they are to be commended for their work on a daily basis. The actions of one officer, however, is not reflective of the entire command staff or the great work that our officers perform each day.
