"Colorimetric Detection of Bovine Serum Albumin by Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Boronate Affinity Chromatography with Conventional Staining: Optimization by Factorial Design\n\nD. J. Lindstedt, F. C. Hanft, and J. P. Weese\n\nCereal Chemistry\n\nVolume 67(4), 380-383\n\nJune 1990\n\nThe detection of serum albumin in bovine milk by sodium dodecyl sulfate-borate affinity chromatography was investigated with the use of Con A stain. After optimization, it was determined that a total of 6.6 ml of bovine plasma (0.5 mg protein/ml) and 1.2 ml of milk sample were sufficient for the analysis of 0.2 ml of milk. A total of 35 ml of buffer A (20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0) containing sodium dodecyl sulfate, boronate, Con A, and 0.5 M sodium sulfate were added to an 8 × 100 mm borosilicate glass column. Bovine plasma and milk samples were passed through the column at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The flow-through was collected and fractions were obtained by passing 1.5 ml of fresh buffer A through the column. Bovine serum albumin was detected in the fractions after staining with the Con A. The mean recovery was 2.78 ± 0.01% for bovine plasma and 1.28 ± 0.07% for bovine milk.\n\nGo to the article in Cereal Chemistry\n\nKeywords: Milk and dairy products, Bioactive compounds, Animals, Mammals, Bovines, Colostrum, Proteins, Bovine, Dried-milk products, Dairy products, Whole milk, Milk fat, Milk-fat globule membranes, Caseins, Sodium dodecyl sulfate, Serum albumin, Affinity chromatography, Sodium dodecyl sulfate-borate, Concanavalin A stain, Affinity chromatography, Affinity separations, Immobilized enzymes
