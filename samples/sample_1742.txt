Shawn Ashmore, the brother of actress Danielle (aka Anna Paquin, star of “The Piano”), played mutant Iceman in the first two X-Men movies and has signed up to appear in two more. Now he’s returning to television in “Two and a Half Men” opposite Ashton Kutcher.\n\n\n\n“I’ve been around that show for so many years,” Ashmore tells PopcornBiz, “and it’s been a great ride. We’ve all seen a lot of changes happen, and I think it’s all very cool.”\n\n\n\nThe role is the first he’s taken in a long time, which the 29-year-old says was a deliberate decision: “I wanted to take a little break from acting and try something new, and this was a great opportunity.”\n\n\n\nHe says he’s excited to work with the Two and a Half Men ensemble, particularly the comedy king himself, Ashton Kutcher: “He’s a really nice guy and very humble. It’s great to have him on set.”\n\n\n\nIceman returns for two more X-Men movies\n\nThe first X-Men was filmed almost four years ago, but now that it’s finished shooting, what is Shawn Ashmore’s favorite memory?\n\n“Getting to play a superhero. That’s the biggest memory, I think, that’ll always stick with me,” he tells PopcornBiz. “I don’t think I’ll ever be in a film that big, where I get to be a superhero, so I’m looking forward to the next one. I think they’re gonna do a really good job with it. I’m excited.”\n\nAshmore’s brother Aaron, as well as his twin sister Kate, also appeared in the X-Men movie, as Pyro and Marrow, respectively. Did they advise him to take the role?\n\n“They were encouraging. They said, ‘It’s the biggest movie you’re going to be in,’ and I had to really think about it,” he recalls. “But in the end, I thought it was a great role to play, and I wanted to do it. I thought the character was really interesting.”\n\nAshmore was only 20 when he started work on the film. Does he remember his first meeting with director Bryan Singer?\n"
