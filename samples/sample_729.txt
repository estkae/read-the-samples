"A band of killer whales was spotted today off the coast of Victoria, British Columbia, with a mystery creature they had killed and were feeding on.\n\nThe encounter, which was captured by boaters on video, was "not common at all," naturalist David Ellifrit told ABC News.\n\n"They do feed on other animals, but it's generally much larger things," he said, estimating the creature was about 20 feet long. "The fact that the whales killed this animal and are feeding on it is really quite unique."\n\nThe 15-member orca pod was spotted at around 2 p.m. about a half mile offshore of Race Rocks, an area of islands and rocks off the southwest coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Ellifrit said. The mammals were hunting a giant squid.\n\n"They've killed it, but they haven't finished feeding yet," he said, adding that he's never seen anything like it in his three decades of experience in the area.\n\nWhile most people think of killer whales eating fish, Ellifrit explained that the mammals are carnivorous and eat marine mammals like seals and other sea creatures like sea lions and large sharks.\n\nCourtesy OrcaLab\n\n"They're really, really fascinating," he said of killer whales. "They're very special animals."\n\nEllifrit said it's impossible to tell from the video if the mysterious animal was a shark or some other sea creature.\n\n"It was clearly dead," he said. "They're playing with it."\n\nHe added that the pod of orcas could have been feeding on the creature for a couple of hours.\n\nCourtesy OrcaLab\n\n"It was moving through the water really, really quickly," he said. "It's probably a shark."\n\nEllifrit noted that this particular orca pod, known as the southern resident killer whales, live in the waters around Vancouver Island and have become a tourist attraction.\n\n"They're one of the stars of the show here," he said.\n\nThe creatures were nearly extinct by the late 1960s, but were saved by a captive breeding program. They are now protected in Canada, and considered an endangered species in the United States.
