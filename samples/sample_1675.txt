On Tuesday, the Texas Supreme Court handed down a decision with great ramifications for public school funding in Texas.\n\nIn the case of Keller Independent School District v. Williams, the Texas Supreme Court unanimously held that the so-called “Robin Hood” school finance system is unconstitutional and is not properly funding public education in Texas.\n\nThe court has held that the current system does not make “available” an “adequate” system of free public schools, the constitutional standard for the financing of public education.\n\nCiting the Legislature’s intent when adopting the “Robin Hood” plan in 1993, the Texas Supreme Court held that the plan was not intended to raise public school funding to adequate levels. The intent of the plan was to remedy the “fund equity” problem, not the problem of inadequate funding. In other words, the “Robin Hood” plan was a tool to distribute the funds to the poorest schools in Texas, not an effort to increase the overall funding for public education.\n\nThe court noted that while a school district may be given more funds for its poor students, it is simultaneously being taken away from other areas of its budget that are not used for poor students.\n\nThe court made the following statements regarding the “Robin Hood” plan:\n\n“If more money for the poor children in one district means less money for other poor children in that district, the same is true for districts that are not identified as having high numbers of poor children. The result is that the children in rich districts such as respondent are funded at higher levels than the children in poorer districts, and there is no evidence that the children in poorer districts are receiving an “adequate education”… The long-established principle is that a State must provide a school system of “substantially equal” educational opportunities to all children within its borders…”\n\nThe court noted that the Legislature, under the “Robin Hood” plan, has failed to “take any meaningful action” to remedy the inadequacies in school funding. Further, the court indicated that the Legislature is not likely to take any significant action to correct the system until it is forced to by a court or the Texas voters.\n\nThe court stated:\n\n“…In addition to the growth in population, the number of school districts, and the number of students in each district, the cost of education has increased. In addition, the Legislature has not provided the level of general revenue funding for public education that has been contemplated. Accordingly, there is a growing need for a new system of school finance. The Legislature must provide the adequate public education required by the Texas Constitution.”\n\nThe court indicated that the Legislature has the authority to establish the amount of public education funding needed in order to provide an “adequate” system of public schools and determine how the system will be funded. The court added that the Legislature “has complete discretion to raise the amount of money needed to provide that funding by whatever means it deems appropriate.”\n\nIn short, it appears that the “Robin Hood” plan, which was adopted by the Legislature in 1993, is now dead.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the Legislature"
