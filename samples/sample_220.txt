This article is about the combat ability. For the status effect, see Poison\n\nFor the Hunter creature, see King black dragon\n\nVenom is a poisonous status effect inflicted by many creatures, and is inflicted by the dragon dagger special move. It deals low damage over time, reducing the player's defence level, and decreasing the effectiveness of protection prayers and similar effects. There is no venom available as a spell in RuneScape.\n\nWhen venom is applied, a timer of 16 seconds begins and the afflicted player receives the message "You are beginning to feel venomous!" This timer can be frozen using either an antipoison, or an antifire potion if the dragon dagger special attack is used against the player.\n\nContents show]\n\nSigns and symptoms Edit\n\nIf you get hit by poison, you may notice the following symptoms:\n\nInability to eat while venom is active (unless the player is using food that heals life points only)\n\nInability to cure poison with antipoison or heal poison using poison cures whilst the venom is active (unless the player is using antipoisons or super antipoisons)\n\nA decrease in defence level\n\nVenom damage Edit\n\nPoison has a poison damage value of 10 + 4 * n {\\displaystyle 10+4*n} , where n {\\displaystyle n} is the number of hits received. This means that the average damage of a venom hit is 22.5% higher than the hit's base damage. The maximum poison damage is 120 + 10 * n {\\displaystyle 120+10*n} , which occurs when the player is hit 16 times by venom.\n\nAs with other damage over time effects, poison damage is not affected by damage modifiers or protection prayers.\n\nResistance Edit\n\nThe player's resistance to venom is related to the player's Defence level, and reduces the damage done by venom accordingly. A player with level 90 Defence or higher will be almost immune to the venom of most dragons, while those with a lower Defence level will take considerable damage from even low-level dragons. The dragon dagger's special attack provides temporary immunity to poison from venom, however this immunity is lost when the dagger's special attack is used up, or if the player unequips the dagger.\n\nTrivia Edit\n\nEven though the Venom poison effect was not in RuneScape Classic, a poisoned player would say the same thing: "I feel a little woozy..."
