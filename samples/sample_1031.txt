Olympian Scott Fox had always planned on becoming a police officer.\n\n"My dad had always been in the police force," he said. "I've always had the dream of going on the police force."\n\nWhen he was 12 years old, he'd sit in his room practicing his writing, hoping it would help him get on the police force when he was older.\n\n"I always thought I'd go on the police force, and I always thought I'd go to the Olympics," he said. "Now, I'm going on the police force and I'm going to the Olympics."\n\nThe journey that took him to the Olympics began at a very early age. When he was 11 years old, his father bought him his first bow.\n\n"My dad bought me a bow, and I just went out in the backyard and shot and shot and shot," he said. "I shot every day and I got better every day."\n\nHe didn't hit the international level until he was 13 years old. In fact, he didn't even know what archery was until he went to an international tournament in New Mexico when he was 12 years old.\n\n"I went and shot my first tournament and I started shooting international tournaments, and I was doing well," he said. "Then, I moved on to the Junior Olympics and then it got more competitive."\n\nIt was at that point he realized that he really had a talent.\n\n"I was pretty good, but not the best," he said. "But then I moved up to the Junior Olympics, and then I got to shooting against the top juniors in the world."\n\nHe placed ninth at the 2000 Junior Olympics in Australia.\n\n"I remember we were in the team compound, and I started shooting my arrows, and the girls I was shooting with were like, 'Wow, you're really good,'" he said. "They were like, 'You know what? You're going to the Olympics. You're going to make the Olympic team.' I was like, 'Yeah right.' It took me a couple of years to believe it."\n\nHe did not go to the Olympics in 2004. He was 18 years old and he hadn't qualified yet.\n\nHe did qualify in 2008, but he did not make the team.\n\nIn fact, he only placed in two of his events in the trials and did not qualify for the Olympic team.\n\n"I did really well in the international tournaments," he said. "It was the trials that I wasn't doing well in. I just wasn't shooting well. I didn't make the team."\n\nHe qualified again in 2012.\n\n"I shot really well in the international tournaments," he said. "I didn't do as well in the trials as I did in 2008, but I made the team."\n\nHe was 18 years old again.\n\n"I got a little older, I got a little more mature," he said. "I was a little more serious. I knew what I wanted to do."\n\nIt was at that point he thought his chances of becoming a police officer were slipping away.\n\n"I started shooting good," he said. "But, I knew what I wanted to do. I knew that I wanted to go on the police force."\n\nHe worked for a couple of years at a range, helping shooters learn how to shoot.\n\nHe kept an eye on the dates of the trials, hoping he would qualify.\n\nIn 2014, he qualified.\n\n"I didn't shoot my best at the trials, but I made the team," he said.\n\nHe was 20 years old.\n\n"It was all just setting up for my life," he said.\n\nIn fact, everything was coming together for him, including his job.\n\n"I got a job at the police department at the college," he said. "So, I had a job at the college, and then I was on the archery team, and then I was going to the Olympics. It was all coming together."\n\nBut, he still had a little more work to do.\n\nHe needed to place in the top six at the trials to qualify.\n\n"I didn't shoot my best," he said. "I did well enough to qualify."\n\nIt was the last time he would compete as an amateur.\n\nHis goal was to place in the top six.\n\n"If I placed in the top six, I would get a medal and it would pay for me to go on the police force," he said. "So, I wanted to get a medal. I was going to do whatever it took to get a medal."\n\nHe had to take a drug test to compete at the trials, and he tested positive for marijuana.\n\n"I didn't know what to do," he said. "I didn't know what to think. It was the only time I ever smoked marijuana."\n\nHe was unsure what to do next.\n\n"I thought, maybe I should pull out of the trials," he said. "But, then I thought about it, and I thought I might as well go on and shoot. I thought I might as well give it a shot."\n\nHe decided to go on.\n\n"I went on to the trials, and I shot great," he said. "I shot better than I shot at the trials."\n\nAnd, in the end, he got a medal.\n\n"I got the bronze medal," he said.\n\n"I wanted a medal, and I got a medal."\n\nIt meant he would have a chance to go to the Olympics.\n\n"My goal was to make it to the Olympics, and that's what I did," he said.\n\nHe began his quest to become a police officer after that.\n\n"I worked out of the Lakewood Police Department," he said. "I was on a street beat."\n\nHe spent a couple of years doing that.\n\n"I didn't like being a cop," he said. "It's a great job, but I didn't like being a cop. It's a tough job, and I didn't want to be a cop. I was enjoying my life and enjoying archery. I was making enough money."\n\nHe decided to try and go back to archery.\n\n"I started going to tournaments and I started winning," he said. "I was shooting well. I got my first world ranking. I made the world ranking."\n\nHe got a sponsorship from Dallenbach Bow Company.\n\n"I was making enough money to pay for my expenses and to pay for my training," he said.\n\nAnd, now, he's on his way to Rio.\n\nHe's 30 years old.\n\n"I qualified this year," he said. "I had to shoot in Vegas and shoot pretty well to qualify. I had to shoot in Sydney and I had to shoot in Manchester."\n\nHe's been to three Olympic trials.\n\n"And, now, I'm going to the Olympics," he said. "It's pretty awesome."\n\n"I've always wanted to be a cop," he said. "That was my dream, and it still is. I just wasn't sure when I would do it. I'm excited."\n\nThe U.S. Olympic Team is looking for funding for the Olympic Trials in Rio.\n\nYou can find the link to the GoFundMe page here: http://www.gofundme.com/usarchery\n\nYou can contact John G.
