Ok, it's over. I had the "pleasure" of being on the phone with my server in Oregon for the last 2 hours and after much coaxing he finally had to unplug it and reboot. It's still in the process of being rebooted but it should be up soon.\n\n\n\nWe do have a small issue in that we are having to reset the network configurations so if you lose connectivity with the site for a few minutes that's why.\n\n\n\nIt was not a power failure, and no lightning strike, so the computer itself was fine. The server was just locked up and would not respond.\n\n\n\nI don't know what happened to cause this, but we've moved the system to a new data center so we'll see how it goes there. If it doesn't work we'll have to go back to the old data center.
