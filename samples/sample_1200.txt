Mahershala Ali was part of the cast of the Oscar-winning Moonlight and stars in Marvel's forthcoming superhero blockbuster, Black Panther.\n\n\n\nHe's the frontrunner to win Best Supporting Actor at the upcoming Academy Awards for his role in Moonlight, and he's already won the Golden Globe. But, in a new interview with The New York Times Magazine, Ali admitted that he didn't have much of a plan for his post-Moonlight life.\n\n"The truth is, I'm pretty much a day-to-day guy," Ali said. "It was one thing at a time. I was doing one job at a time, getting to live one dream at a time."\n\nAli, who is a Muslim, said he was surprised at how he was depicted in the media when the movie's director, Barry Jenkins, said that a scene in the film depicting two gay men falling in love was important to him because it depicted an all-black cast in a way that was "natural and effortless."\n\n"The narrative around it became, 'Black people are gay,'" Ali said. "Well, they’re not. I mean, we know they’re gay. We live with them. I love them. It was nothing more than, 'I’m glad that this image of my people is being seen.'"\n\nAli has said he'll donate his proceeds from the movie to charity, but that he wants to invest the time he would have spent fundraising into community building.\n\n"I have a foundation that helps artists," he said. "You’re looking at the person who needs the help, I’m looking at the person who’s got all the help. I’m trying to balance it."\n\nAli went to high school in Sacramento, California, with Amma Asante, who went on to direct A United Kingdom and Belle.\n\n"I didn’t know she was a director," he said. "But she always was telling stories."\n\nThat's a recurring theme, actually, in Ali's life: It turns out that Hollywood casting directors have also been helping to tell Ali's story. They keep making him audition for parts he's never going to get.\n\n"Every time I see the casting sheet," he said, "it’s all these things for handsome, fit, cool, nonethnic, sexual leading men, and I’m like, 'Am I being Punk’d? I’ve been telling my story all along. What are you looking for?'"\n\nRelated: Mahershala Ali Explains Why Moonlight's Love Scenes Are Important
