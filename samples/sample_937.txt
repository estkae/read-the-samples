Helpfulness\n\nOriginally, we had wanted to hike this trail from the beginning of the parking lot (the lot is located a little under a mile from the trailhead). But the area was a little busy that day (7/24) with other hikers and day-trippers so we decided to just park at the trailhead and save the 1 mile walk from the parking lot. As a result, we didn't get to see any of the cute animals (though I have no doubt they were out there somewhere) and only saw one other hiker along the way.\n\n\n\nThis trail is located in Pisgah National Forest on the side of Nantahala mountain. It is one of the most difficult trails in the area with sheer drops and rugged terrain.\n\n\n\nThe good: For a more advanced hiker, this is a great trail. It is strenuous but not overly long (5.8 miles). The end is a great waterfall, which is easy to get to if you don't mind getting wet.\n\n\n\nThe not so good: If you are hiking with a family or kids, you'll be facing a very difficult trail that is more dangerous than fun. If you aren't an advanced hiker and you are looking for a scenic hike, this isn't the trail for you.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the trail, you come to a fork in the road. Take a left to begin your hike. Shortly after the trail begins, you will come to a second fork in the road. If you go right, you will be continuing on the AT.\n\n\n\nAfter that, the trail begins to climb at a steady, though not difficult pace. There are numerous points that overlook small streams or the valley below. It is a great trail for experiencing the scenery.\n\n\n\nAbout halfway, the trail reaches the first stream crossing. The trail passes under a stone bridge (that is in remarkably good condition) before crossing the stream. The trail continues, but is a little steep at this point. The good news is that the trail flattens out shortly thereafter and you have to navigate over a few rock formations.\n\n\n\nWhen you reach the intersection with the second stream, the trail is fairly obvious. Take the left fork, which will take you around the falls and to the top of the falls. From here you can see the falls below, which is a huge waterfall that is visible from the valley below.\n\n\n\nFrom the top of the falls, the trail flattens out again. Take the trail to the left to take you over to the base of the falls. There is a rock platform from which you can safely take pictures and view the falls. There are spots that you can stand in the water and enjoy the falls. From the top of the falls, it is about 2 miles back to the trailhead, which is an easy walk.
