Nepal captain Paras Khadka says his side are aiming to win the ICC World Cricket League Division 5 and seal a place in next year's ICC World Cup Qualifier.\n\nThe five-team event in Jersey gets underway on Monday and Nepal are joined by Canada, Kenya, Namibia and USA.\n\n"We are excited and nervous as it is a big tournament, especially for us as it is our last chance to qualify for the World Cup Qualifier," Khadka told ICC's official website. "It is a great opportunity for us to qualify as hosts of the next World Cup Qualifier and make a big statement.\n\n"This is the first time that we are playing the teams in our group so we have to play positive cricket. We need to win as many games as we can and get to the final," he added.\n\nAll five sides are vying to be crowned the first champions of this competition and get one step closer to the World Cup Qualifier in Ireland and Scotland in 2018.\n\nThey will all play two round-robin matches, followed by a play-off for the top two sides, who will then face off in a final to determine the overall winner.\n\nNepal are placed in Group A and will open their campaign against hosts Jersey at Mont a la Roque on Monday, before facing Canada at the same venue on Thursday.\n\nKhadka says his side will use the matches against the host nation to gauge their performance and assess their strengths and weaknesses.\n\n"We are excited to play Jersey as we want to see our performance against a tough opposition. It will be a test for us. We don't have much information on them so we have to play with our strengths and see how it goes.\n\n"Our goal is to finish on top of our group and play the final. If we win, it will be our first World Cup Qualifier and we will be looking to get a few more players into the national team. That is a massive goal for us.\n\n"We need to play fearless cricket, which we will be doing."\n\nNepal will also face USA on Friday at Les Quennevais, while their final game against Kenya takes place at the same venue on Tuesday.\n\nIn Group B, Canada will take on Kenya at Les Quennevais on Monday, before taking on Namibia at the same venue on Thursday.\n\nThe group's other two matches will see hosts Jersey take on Namibia at Beaulieu on Monday and USA face Canada at Beaulieu on Thursday.
