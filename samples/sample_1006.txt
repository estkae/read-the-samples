Ted S. Warren/Associated Press\n\nFor the Seattle Seahawks, the 2018 NFL draft was all about defense. The organization used seven of its eight picks on that side of the ball, and two of those selections—defensive lineman Rasheem Green (No. 79 overall) and cornerback Tre Flowers (No. 180 overall)—were fourth-rounders.\n\nWith each of those players, the team now boasts a higher grade on the depth chart than it did before the draft, but as to how the team grades out as a whole, it’s unclear. We won’t have an answer to that question for at least a year.\n\nHere’s a look at the Seahawks’ draft class and how each of the players might fit into the team’s future.\n\nRasheem Green, DE, USC\n\nGreen was a highly productive player at USC. In three years with the Trojans, he totaled 45.5 tackles for loss and 20 sacks. According to Pro Football Focus, he ranked in the top 20 of 4-3 defensive ends in the nation in 2017 with a grade of 83.6.\n\nThe Seahawks are stacked on the defensive line, and at the time of his selection, Green was slotted as a fourth- or fifth-round talent. The fact that the Seahawks traded up to select him, and that he was the second defensive lineman taken in this draft, means that the team was likely really high on him and expects him to contribute as a rookie.\n\nThe Seahawks are deep on the defensive line, though, and while Green was one of the most productive defensive ends in the nation, his value on the team is unclear. Expect him to compete for a spot on the 53-man roster, but for him to be active on game day as a rookie would be a surprise.\n\nRashaad Penny, RB, San Diego State\n\nAs a player, Penny has been discussed at length. He’s going to have a chance to compete for the starting running back spot, and while he’s not an exceptional athlete, his college tape shows a player with all of the traits to be a solid runner in the NFL.\n\nThe Seahawks have been a power running team for a while, and they’ve had a lot of success in that scheme. Adding a runner like Penny could be the final piece of the puzzle.\n\nThe Seahawks had a couple of running backs get hurt last season, and adding a player like Penny would make it easier to withstand those injuries.\n\nAt the same time, though, the Seahawks have a lot of bodies at running back, and only one football to go around. We may see the team go with a running back by committee approach this season, which could keep Penny off the field early on in the season.\n\nShaquem Griffin, LB, Central Florida\n\nAt the NFL combine, Griffin—who lost his left hand due to a birth defect—recorded 20 repetitions in the bench press. That’s more than any other linebacker in this draft. Griffin’s story is an amazing one, and it’s something he’s going to have to use to his advantage as he tries to become a player in the NFL.\n\nThere are already comparisons to Antonio Brown, but Griffin won’t be on the field in the slot. Instead, he’ll likely play weakside linebacker, where his run defense will be an asset.\n\nGriffin’s draft grade was a seventh-round pick or an undrafted free agent, so the Seahawks could’ve waited until the later rounds to select him. Instead, they selected him in the third round, meaning that the team really believes in him.\n\nLook for him to make the final 53-man roster, but for him to have a chance at being active on game days, he’s going to need to be a standout special"
