The Sicilian Naval Battlefleet, 1066\n\nIn 1066 the Normans of Southern Italy invaded Sicily, starting a century of Norman rule in Sicily, and increasing the Sicilian fleet. This fleet, in 1066, had two hundred large galleys, eighty medium galleys, thirty large carracks and ten small ones. The numbers might have been larger, for in 1067, the Sicilian fleet is estimated at a thousand ships. After 1086, with the decline of naval power, the Sicilian fleet declined.
