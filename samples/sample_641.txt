Never before have there been so many ways to get around town. Your old friend, the car, still plays an important part, but these days you can also get there on a bike, by bus, via carpool or through an online service. The new wave of bike-sharing services, using dockless bikes, are particularly useful for getting around short distances.\n\nGetting around is an integral part of life in Munich. But this means that the cityâ€™s public transport network needs to keep up with increasing demand and changing travel patterns. The introduction of intelligent transport systems, such as automatic vehicle and passenger counting and the integration of new vehicle concepts, has opened up a whole new range of options.\n\nThe automatic vehicle counting system helps to better inform passengers and to optimise service deployment. And as the focus turns to sustainable mobility, the use of electric vehicles has taken off in the city. One example is the KITT-shuttle: the KISS project is working on a prototype of this e-shuttle for low-floor public transport.
