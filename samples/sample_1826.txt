"By Michel Rose\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - France plans to strengthen monitoring of people convicted of terrorism, according to a draft bill presented to cabinet on Thursday and seen by Reuters.\n\nThe legislation, drawn up after attacks in Paris last year by Islamist militants, seeks to broaden a current surveillance scheme that applies only to people jailed for crimes involving weapons or explosives.\n\n"These are individuals convicted for terrorism, with sentences of more than five years in jail, who have been released or are serving time in a half-way house," a source at the Interior Ministry said.\n\nThe new system would put convicted terrorists under close surveillance by intelligence agencies for up to 12 months after their release from prison.\n\n(Reporting by Michel Rose; Editing by Tom Heneghan)
