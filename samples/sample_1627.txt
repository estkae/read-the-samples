After I hired a mortgage broker, I was told I had to have an inspection. I did not know anything about home inspectors and their responsibilities. My real estate agent referred Mr. Lazlo to me. I cannot say enough about the service I received. My inspector was very thorough and informative. He spent a lot of time with me explaining all the things that need to be repaired, replaced and or maintained. He even went as far as to explain how to maintain my furnace and explained in detail why. My real estate agent even complimented him on his thoroughness. When I am ready to buy my next home I will definitely call Mr. Lazlo for my inspection.” – Olessa S, Manahawkin NJ\n\n“Dear Mr. Lazlo, I was told about you from my real estate broker, Dave Winters, of RE/MAX Select.
