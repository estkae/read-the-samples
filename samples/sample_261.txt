(Quran 3:19)\n\nA Hindu must strive to become a better person and have patience, and trust in God.\n\nThe QURAN says as\n\n“And it is He who sent down to you the Book. In it are verses that are entirely clear, they are the foundation of the Book; and others not entirely clear. As for those in whose hearts there is a deviation (from the truth) they follow that which is not entirely clear thereof, seeking discord and seeking an interpretation (suitable to them). And no one knows its [true] interpretation except God. But those firm in knowledge say, “We believe in it. All [of it] is from our Lord.” And no one will be reminded except those of understanding. (Quran 3:7)\n\nWe must follow what is in the Quran and what was said by the Prophet (PBUH).\n\nWe can learn from all great men.\n\nIt is written in the Quran as\n\n“To you we sent the scripture in truth, confirming the scripture that came before it, and guarding it in safety: so judge between them by what God has revealed, and do not follow their low desires [to turn away] from the truth that has come to you. For each of you We have appointed a law and a way. If God had so willed, He would have made you a single community, but [He intended] to test you in what He has given you; so strive as in a race in all virtues. The goal of you all is to God; it is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which you dispute.” (Quran 5:48)\n\nThe Quran says as\n\n“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.” (Quran 5:3)\n\nHindus must believe in God and His Prophets.\n\nThe Quran says as\n\n“The similitude of Jesus before God is as that of Adam; He created him from dust, then said to him: “Be”.

Difficult for those who associate others with God is that to which you invite them. God chooses for Himself whom He wills and guides to Himself whoever turns back [to Him].” (Quran 42:13)\n\nThe Quran says as\n\n“You [true believers in Islamic Monotheism, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad and his Sunnah (legal ways, etc.)] are the best nation produced [as an example] for mankind.

And you will certainly hear from those who were given the Scripture before you and from those who associate others with God much abuse. But if you are patient and fear God – indeed, that is of the matters [worthy] of determination.” (Quran 3:186)\n\nThe Hindu should seek the guidance of God.\n\nThe Quran says as\n\n“Is it not to God that sincere devotion is due?

But God guides not such as are false and ungrateful.” (Quran 16:72)\n\nThe Hindu should follow the teachings of the Quran.\n\nIt is written in the Quran as\n\n“Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in God hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks.
