Giant scale model\n\n\n\nSide note\n\nBought in New York. My first gigapan, and I don't know if it worked. I used an auto timer on the camera, and moved the camera to a tripod as well, but I think I moved too quickly. I did a slight "edit" on it by changing the colors a bit and used a slightly different size to get a more accurate view of the whole object. I think it worked well. It has lots of things I don't recognize. Probably because I'm from a small town in southern Indiana, USA. I'm actually kind of suprised that it even fits in the frame.\n\nFull Resolution, if you want to look at a close up of the item\n\ngigapan.org/gigapans/72917/\n\nDone
