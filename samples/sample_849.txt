As of the time of this writing, there is no announced start date for the season, but a statement on the NHLPA website indicated that there was a “potential for a short, intensified period of labor negotiations,” and that the players were willing to play once a deal is reached.\n\nIt is unfortunate that fans will have to wait longer to see their favorite stars on the ice, but the upcoming Olympics will help ease the pain. Players that are still in the midst of play in the post season will have some time to rest"
