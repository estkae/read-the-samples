The Carabao Cup was first played for in 1971/72. However, the EFL had previously played a knock-out competition in a similar format - the Football League Cup - in 1960/61.\n\nSince its inception in the 1970s, the Carabao Cup has gone from strength to strength, as the competition is now widely regarded as the country’s second most prestigious cup competition.\n\nAs well as the main trophy, the winner of the Carabao Cup also receive a cash prize of £90,000 and they qualify for the following season's UEFA Europa League.\n\nThe competition's format is open to a total of 88 teams: all 20 members of the Premier League and at least the first three teams from each of the Championship, League One and League Two (if the winners of those competitions have already qualified for Europe through their league position).\n\nThe non-league clubs that do not qualify for Europe are then invited to play in the competition, while the top four from the FA Vase and the winners of the FA Trophy, EFL Cup and EFL Trophy enter at the third-round stage.\n\nThe team with the highest finish in the League One or League Two is given the final place in the third round.\n\nMatches are two-legged (except the final, which is one-off), with the team with the highest aggregate score in each leg proceeding to the next round.\n\nFrom the fourth round onwards, the format reverts to a single-game, with extra-time and penalties used if required.
