"Christians are a people of grace. Grace is defined as the unmerited favor of God, which is given freely to sinners. I found this note in my Bible:\n\nThere is nothing you can do to earn it and there is nothing you can do to deserve it. It is the free, undeserved gift of God to sinners.\n\nI got to thinking about how it is hard for people to understand God’s grace. First, people don’t understand how much grace there is. If God only gave grace to people who deserved it, the whole world would be doomed. And the second thing is that people don’t understand that God is the source of that grace. If God was a tyrant, he would demand that people earn his love by being perfect, which would be impossible.\n\nHere is a great article by Warren Wiersbe titled The Gift of Grace. I think you will find it helpful.\n\nPaul is telling us that we are complete in Christ (Colossians 2:10). He is all we need in this life. There is no need for religious rituals or works of any kind. All of those are part of the old order, which is fading away.
