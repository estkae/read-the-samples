International School of Helsinki\n\nTeacher of French\n\nJari Pohjola\n\nI studied French at the University of Helsinki, completing a BA in 2004 and an MA in 2006. In 2004, I started working as an Assistant Language Teacher (ALT) at Helsinki International School, initially teaching Finnish and then later moving to the French department in the autumn of 2007. I completed a certificate in teaching French as a second language at the University of Helsinki in 2009 and then continued to study at the school’s ‘Master’s level’ programme, which I completed in 2010.\n\nIn the future, I hope to continue my studies by pursuing a Ph.D. in the field of language teaching methodology. I have also been teaching at the university level since 2011.\n\nAs well as working at the International School of Helsinki, I also work as a freelance teacher of French at other language centres in Helsinki, working with various age groups and also teaching as a private tutor. I am currently the Coordinator of the Curriculum Committee at the school, and also the chair of the French Department, having previously held the position of Chair of the Department of Modern Languages from 2010 to 2014.\n\nI live in Helsinki with my wife and our two sons, aged four and one.\n\nSchool:
