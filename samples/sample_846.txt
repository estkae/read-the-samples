I found that this forum do not have a facility to upload a zip file (for the moment). How would be the best way to share a file with the developers?\n\n\n\nThe question:\n\n\n\nAfter the download of version 4.0.3 I cannot start a layout. A dialogue box appears and say that the application can not be started because of a missing or damaged library.\n\nPlease can I get a list of the files that are missing?\n\nI have the following files in the directory C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Routz:\n\n- Routz4.exe\n\n- Routz4.exe.md5\n\n- Routz4.x64.dll\n\n- Routz4.x64.dll.md5\n\n- Routz4.x64.exe\n\n- Routz4.x64.exe.md5\n\n- Routz4.x64.pdb\n\n- Routz4.x64.pdb.md5\n\n- Routz4.x86.dll\n\n- Routz4.x86.dll.md5\n\n- Routz4.x86.exe\n\n- Routz4.x86.exe.md5\n\n- Routz4.x86.pdb\n\n- Routz4.x86.pdb.md5\n\n- Routz4.x86.zip\n\n- Routz4.x86.zip.md5\n\n- Routz4.xml\n\n- Routz4.xml.md5\n\n- RoutzPro_x64.dll\n\n- RoutzPro_x64.dll.md5\n\n- RoutzPro_x64.exe\n\n- RoutzPro_x64.exe.md5\n\n- RoutzPro_x64.pdb\n\n- RoutzPro_x64.pdb.md5\n\n- RoutzPro_x86.dll\n\n- RoutzPro_x86.dll.md5\n\n- RoutzPro_x86.exe\n\n- RoutzPro_x86.exe.md5\n\n- RoutzPro_x86.pdb\n\n- RoutzPro_x86.pdb.md5\n\n\n\nRegards Lief Helst
