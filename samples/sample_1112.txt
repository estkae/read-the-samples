The Alien Elite version is what every Alienware buyer is always clamoring for. Of course, it will cost a little more than the standard.\n\nCNET Reviews has reviewed the Alienware M17x gaming laptop. "As with all Alienware gaming laptops, the high-end version of the M17x costs about as much as an Xbox 360. However, it also delivers some of the most impressive gaming performance we've ever seen on a laptop, and that makes it worth a look for gamers who can afford it. At a more reasonable price, we'd also recommend the standard version for people looking for the ultimate 17-inch gaming laptop, but we feel the higher-end configuration is a must for anyone looking for a real gaming experience."\n\n"The Alienware M17x is a high-end 17-inch gaming laptop that's best suited for those who don't mind spending a lot of money for the best hardware available. If you're just looking for a machine that will let you play games at a decent frame rate, you can find better options elsewhere." -- By Erik Sofge, CNET Reviews.\n\nRead the full review here.\n\nContact sales@alienware.com for more information.
