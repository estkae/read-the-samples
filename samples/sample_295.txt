The mainline of PC’s arrived on Friday in great shape. In addition to the newer No. 3 (blue) there was an earlier No. 4 (green), a No. 5, and two later No. 5’s. To fill the gaps between these 5’s I bought two…well, three…plows from another fellow who also had lots of couplers and castings. It’s good to have some of each for testing fit of things, but for permanent operation I’ll probably want to get a handful of No. 5’s.\n\nNow it’s back to finishing the minis and collecting the accessories. The insides of these last few cars could use some work, like fitting the walls for the corner curves. I’ll do that at the same time as adding the doors, and a couple of weeks should have them done. Once the house is done I’ll probably just keep building trains and cars for a while, rather than finishing the accessory set.\n\n-- Charlie M. "Woodworking - patience = firewood\
