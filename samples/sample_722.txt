If you want a free pet but you're allergic to cats and dogs, consider a rabbit. There are so many different breeds out there and each breed has different personality traits. If you do your research, you can easily find the breed that is right for you. There are rabbits that are great lap pets while others are not so great and would rather be sitting in their own personal hutch.\n\nThe most common type of rabbit is the domestic rabbit. Domestic rabbits can be either the mini version or the full size version. The difference between the two is the mini version has a shorter body and the full size has a longer body. Some breeds will have more length to them than others.\n\nThe most common of the domestic rabbit breeds is the Holland Lop. The Holland Lop has a tiny, short body, stocky build, and short fur. Their fur is typically brown and they have floppy ears that hang down along their body. They're also very friendly, are very cuddly, and are fairly easy to care for.\n\nThe second most common of the domestic rabbit breeds is the Dutch. This rabbit breed has a longer body, stocky build, and short fur. Their fur is typically brown or white. They're not very friendly, but if you take the time to tame them, they can become very cuddly and affectionate. They are very vocal and have a "honking" type of noise they make when they're excited.\n\nThe third most common of the domestic rabbit breeds is the lionhead. The lionhead has a shorter body, stocky build, and a long coat of hair. The lionhead is also fairly vocal and has a "honking" type of noise they make when they're excited. They're not as friendly as the Dutch and the Holland Lop, but if you take the time to tame them, they can become very cuddly and affectionate.\n\nRabbits are great pets and if you decide to adopt one, make sure you find the breed that's right for you.
