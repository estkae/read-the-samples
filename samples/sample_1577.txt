What is it?\n\nThe SKLZ AutoReel Hoops features two heavy duty chrome-plated steel handles and 40" removable nylon cord with two loops at each end to attach to any door.\n\nThe cord is long enough to reach just over half-court for any young player.\n\nUnlike traditional hoop systems that have loose springs or wires that attach to the backboard, the AutoReel system uses steel-cable tubing to keep the tension constant and avoid any danger of the spring or wire breaking.\n\nA swivel clip secures the cord to the base for use indoors or outdoors, on a garage door or a fence.\n\nHow does it feel?\n\nThe system is easy to use. Simply remove the cord from the base and attach to a door or fence and then wind it up.\n\nI had a couple of issues with the AutoReel, however.\n\nIt takes two hands to get the cord up to the door, so there's no way to easily wind it back up by yourself.\n\nThis is easily remedied by adding a hook to your garage door or fence, but it's still a little annoying.\n\nIn addition, the handle is very short (24") and the cord was a bit hard to pull back and rewind.\n\nWhat can it be used for?\n\nThe system has three options for use.\n\nFirst, and most obviously, is for regular shooting.\n\nIt can also be used as a way to rebound the ball from a stationary position without having to chase after it.\n\nLastly, the cord can be set up at different lengths for different heights.\n\nThis is perfect for younger kids who need to shoot over shorter distances, or for older kids who need to work on long-distance shots.\n\nWho is it for?\n\nThis is a great system for players of all ages. It will easily help kids who are struggling with their shooting mechanics get the fundamentals down.\n\nSince the cord can be set up at different lengths, it will also work for all ages. It's a great system for any parent who wants to keep their kids off the computer.\n\nAny concerns?\n\nI had a few issues with the system, but none that are serious enough to stop me from recommending it.\n\nThe handles are a little small and hard to pull back and rewind.\n\nThe cord is a little heavy and hard to pull back and rewind.\n\nThe AutoReel is also quite bulky compared to a traditional, portable hoop.\n\nAnything else I should know?\n\nThis hoop is a great option for older kids who might want to shoot in the driveway when it's too cold or wet to shoot on a regulation hoop.\n\nIt's also perfect for any adult who wants to work on their form without having to set up a full-size hoop.
