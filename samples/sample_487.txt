This is not a bug or something that is wrong. The game is not detecting your Shield as something that it can block. The animation itself looks fine. I don't know how you can replicate it yourself to get a screenshot, but what you are seeing is the default Shieldblock animation without your Shield in your inventory.\n\n\n\nIf you are referring to the broken animation for Normal and Magic Shieldblock, the bug with that is fixed on 0.11.4. I'm not sure when we'll be able to patch that for Ascendancy.

When you block, the shield is on your back. When you use your shield in the skill, it isn't. The game can't detect your shield. When you block, the shield is on your back.
