THE WORLD:Warm air blanketed much of the United States, setting record-breaking highs across the country in some areas, the National Weather Service reported.\n\nFLASHBACK: On June 2, 2008, I reported that there was a double-dip forecast by NOAA for the U.S. ( click here ) and Canada ( click here ) by NOAA. But as I have been pointing out in my weather report, the cooling trend has been continuing, and may have entered a new stage.\n\nThis is not good news for a lot of farmers, especially when you are growing winter crops.\n\nReport from the National Climatic Data Center:\n\nJanuary-through-May 2009 was the warmest such period on record for the contiguous United States. The average temperature of 51.0°F was 5.2°F above the 1901-2000 average and surpassed the previous record (set in 2007) by 0.2°F. This was also the third consecutive warm January-through-May period in the United States and also broke the record for the warmest such period.\n\nOnly seven states and the District of Columbia had below-average temperatures for January-through-May 2009, and these were scattered from New York and New Jersey to Arizona. Alaska and Hawaii were the two states with above-average temperatures for the first five months of 2009, while every other state was above average, including the District of Columbia.\n\nThe May 2009 nationwide temperature was the warmest on record for the contiguous United States, at 2.7°F above the 1901-2000 average. This surpassed the previous record (set in 2005) by 0.1°F and was also the second consecutive record warm May.\n\nThe warm temperatures across the United States contributed to the many record high temperatures for May 2009.\n\n(click here to read the full story)
