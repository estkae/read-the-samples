"As word spread of the new church’s intentions, many Muslims came to have a look. “They were surprised to see Christians.”\n\nKoberg said he was surprised to see the modest construction was built as quickly as it was.\n\n“We have enough of everything we need. We have enough food, we have shelter, and there is security. We’ve built what we could,” said Mohammed. “They are very good, very nice. We’re working together.”\n\nBut Muslim leaders in the area are concerned that the church is being built on a spot where a mosque stood for about 80 years.\n\nEarlier this year, tensions between Christians and Muslims flared up when a Catholic hospital in the nearby city of Bauchi shut down its maternity ward, arguing that the government did not give it enough money to operate. As Muslims felt that the ward’s closing was unfair, they attacked the hospital, which is run by the Italian-based congregation of Daughters of Mary Immaculate.\n\nKoberg said he was surprised that no one has reacted to the construction of the church so far.\n\n“Nobody has said anything.”\n\nThe Protestants in Maiduguri had been looking for a new place to worship for months. They are not the only Christians in town, but they are the only ones without a church. Now they can freely worship their God.
