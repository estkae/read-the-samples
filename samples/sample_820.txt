In order to successfully use the drones and sensors, which are needed for a safe and efficient inspection of large and complex facilities, a web based analysis and evaluation platform is needed. The platform is called “SAFE-WEB” and is presented in the paper. SAFE-WEB allows an easy registration of sensors and drones. Furthermore, it gives the possibility to integrate and visualize the obtained data. Furthermore, several types of risk analysis are possible in SAFE-WEB. A unique feature is the capability to specify an area, where drones and/or sensors can fly, and to create a risk analysis only for the desired area. This makes it possible to perform an efficient analysis and evaluation of the obtained data. Finally, an example of the application of the risk analysis will be presented. The application is carried out using a 3D model of a Nuclear Facility.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nNuclear power stations represent very large facilities. In general, the normal plant operation comprises many smaller building units. The normal surveillance is, therefore, divided into different parts of the plant and has the advantage that it is not necessary to inspect the whole plant in one time.\n\nIn the paper the 3D model of a nuclear power plant is analyzed and assessed using the available drone and sensor data. The analysis of the model is necessary because the object is used to specify the area for the flight of the drones and to set the risk analysis region.\n\n1.1. Area for Drones\n\nThe advantage of drones for inspections is that they can fly directly in the area, which is of interest. This is not possible using normal manned aircraft. The limitation of drones is that they have to be within the control of the operator. They have to be able to see them in order to be able to control them. The control is needed to avoid collision with other drones or collisions with the buildings of the object. In this paper, two options for the control of the drones are presented. The first is an autonomous flight control and the second is the control via an operator.\n\nFigure 1.1. shows the “area for drones” for the 3D model of the nuclear facility. This area is created by the operator who specifies the region, where drones should be allowed to fly and where the analysis should be performed. For example, the operator can select the area shown in Figure 1.1. and then the drones and sensors are used to perform the analysis and evaluation only in this area.\n\nFigure 1.1. Area for the drones.\n\n1.2. Risk Analysis Region\n\nThe drones and sensors need a clearly specified area to carry out the analysis. The area is called “risk analysis region”. For example, if the operator selects the area shown in Figure 1.1. for the analysis, the drones and sensors fly in this area. Then, the data are gathered and analyzed by the operator. Then, the result is presented to the operator.\n\nIn this paper, two different options for the risk analysis are presented. The first one is an automatic risk analysis, where the user specifies a maximum amount of permissible risk. The second option is the capability to specify a risk analysis region with a boundary, where the area is cut off, where drones and sensors are not allowed to fly. In this paper, the automatic risk analysis is presented.\n\nThe capability to automatically generate the risk analysis region is a great advantage. The operator does not need to know the exact area of interest. He just specifies a general area. The automatic risk analysis can be performed in several levels. The highest level includes several basic items like structural failure, fire, blast and irradiation. This level of analysis is also called “super-level”.\n\nThe super-level is a very large amount of data. The number of variables is about 25 times the number of variables for the normal risk analysis. Because of this, the super-level is used only if there is a specific need for it.\n\nThe analysis is very useful and important to perform inspections, which will be controlled by drones and sensors. In this paper, the analysis is applied to the nuclear facility shown in Figure 1.2. This nuclear power plant consists of five units. Three of these units are different types of nuclear reactors. The main part of the nuclear power plant is the “containment building” which is not shown in Figure 1.2. The small boxes in Figure 1.2 are the different units, which are part of the nuclear facility.\n\nFigure 1.2. Nuclear power plant\n\nIn order to create the analysis, several sensors are used. Figure 1.3 shows the sensors, which are necessary for the analysis of the nuclear facility shown in Figure 1.2. There are four drones which are used to create the top view. Furthermore, there are two sensors which are needed to gather the data for the analysis. One sensor is a small helicopter and the second one is a car. The sensors are used to gather data like radiation, temperatures and stress on the walls of the building.\n\nFigure 1.3. Sensors for the analysis\n\n2. Preparation of the Model for the Analysis\n\nIn this section, the preparation of the model for the analysis is shown.\n\nThe main part of the preparation of the model is to create a map which shows the 3D area. Figure 1.4 shows the map of the model. The big rectangle shows the total area of the nuclear facility. Inside the rectangle, the specific area of interest is shown. The analysis will only be performed inside the area shown in Figure 1.4. The selected area is large enough to allow a safe flight of the drones. The selected area is used to generate the analysis region and it is also used to specify the area for the drones and sensors.\n\nFigure 1.4. Map of the model\n\nIn addition to the area for the drones and sensors, the following must be defined:\n\nThe locations of the drones\n\nThe locations of the sensors\n\nA description of the analysis, which is carried out on the drones and sensors\n\nFurthermore, the model needs to be prepared for the required analysis. To do this, the sensor data and the drone data are to be analyzed.\n\n2.1. Sensor Data\n\nThe sensor data are measured by the sensors in the area, where the analysis is to be performed. The data are gathered by the sensors and then sent to the operator. The operator can analyze the data and then specify the risk analysis area and the risk analysis itself.\n\nThe sensors are used for the following measurements:\n\nRadiation\n\nTemperature\n\nStress on the walls\n\nOne of the important measurements is radiation. The following data are required for the analysis of the radiation:\n\nPeak value\n\nAverage value\n\nArea\n\nFor each measurement, one or more locations are defined. The data are then gathered and a map, which shows the measurement result, is created. Figure 1.5 shows an example of the map. The map shows the radiation measured in one of the locations. In addition, the peak value, average value and the area of the radiation is shown in the map.\n\nFigure 1.5. Example of the map, which shows the measurement results\n\nThe data are shown in a map which has a high resolution. Figure 1.5. shows a map with a resolution of 1m x 1m.\n\n2.2. Drone Data\n\nThe drone data is the result of the data gathered by the drones in the area, where the analysis is to be performed. The data are gathered and the drone control software interprets the data. The results of the data are sent to the operator and they are used to determine the analysis region.\n\nThe data, which are used for the analysis of the drones are:\n\nRadiation\n\nTemperature\n\nStress on the walls\n\nOne of the important data is radiation. The following data are required for the analysis of the radiation:\n\nPeak value\n\nAverage value\n\nArea\n\nFor each measurement, one or more locations are defined. The data are then gathered and a map, which shows the measurement result, is created. Figure 1.6 shows an example of the map. The map shows the radiation measured in one of the locations. In addition, the peak value, average value and the area of the radiation is shown in the map.\n\nFigure 1.6. Example of the map, which shows the measurement results\n\nThe data are shown in a map which has a high resolution. Figure 1.6. shows a map with a resolution of 1m x 1m.\n\n2.3. Analysis of the Drone Data\n\nThe drone data is used to create the analysis region. This is done by specifying the area in which the drone can fly and by creating the risk analysis.\n\nTo do this, the operator creates a map, which shows the drone flight area. Figure 1.7. shows the drone flight area for the 3D model of the nuclear power plant. The flight area has a large size because the drones are controlled by an operator. This means that the drones have to be in the range of the operator’s sight. For this reason, the area has to be big.\n\nFigure 1.7. Drone flight area\n\nThe drone flight area is then used to create the risk analysis. Figure 1.8. shows the risk analysis for the drone flight area. The drone flight area is shown in blue. The analysis is created for the area where the operator can see the drones.\n\nFigure 1.8. Drone flight area and risk analysis\n\nThe operator has several options to create the risk analysis. In this paper, the operator can define a maximum level of permissible risk for the radiation. This means that the risk analysis is carried out automatically. In this way
