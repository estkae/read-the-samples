A state-by-state review of vehicle regulations for autonomous vehicles that the Society of Automotive Engineers released Thursday revealed that a patchwork of rules could emerge for driverless cars.\n\nEven with federal regulations now under consideration, the legal framework for self-driving vehicles is far from settled.\n\nFor example, at least 14 states currently prohibit drivers from using mobile devices to record video or take pictures while behind the wheel, according to the SAE report, while only two states—New York and Louisiana—provide no restrictions against the practice.\n\nIn addition, more than half of the states have passed laws prohibiting a vehicle’s occupants from being able to watch a video display for entertainment while the vehicle is in motion. Only two states—New Hampshire and New Jersey—expressly prohibit the practice, but New Jersey’s law is not clear if it extends to autonomous vehicles, according to the SAE.\n\nMore than half of the states also require drivers to be seated while operating a vehicle, but the existing laws vary widely in whether they are enforced for autonomous vehicles. For example, at least 12 states specifically exempt autonomous vehicles from such regulations.\n\nMeanwhile, some rules that apply to drivers are difficult to enforce when there is no person behind the wheel.\n\nNearly half of the states, for example, prohibit drivers from using a mobile device while parked on a highway. And a similar number of states ban a person from riding in a vehicle’s bed while the vehicle is in motion, according to the report. But it would be difficult for a law enforcement official to spot a person in the back of a vehicle, for example, without a camera mounted on the vehicle, the report noted.\n\nSuch a problem could arise if a vehicle is occupied only by an autonomous vehicle operator"
