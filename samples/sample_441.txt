However, after a last-minute bid from Sony Pictures Television, it was ordered to a special two-part finale. The shows were meant to resolve the cliffhanger, and answer why Rufus was shot and where Lucy and Wyatt ended up. However, when the episode aired, nothing was resolved.\n\nRelated: Timeless Fits Perfectly Into The Revival TV Movement\n\nIn an interview with Syfy Wire, Kripke revealed he's hoping for a season 4 so that the show can get a proper ending.\n\n"We always conceived of [the finale] as a potential series finale, because we couldn’t get canceled! So that’s just what it ended up being. It’s like, “OK, we can’t end the show, so let’s end the arc.” It felt really appropriate and full circle, and everybody at NBC, Sony and Warner Bros. was like, “That’s a perfect place to end this.” We’re not ruling out a future for the show. Who knows? We still feel passionately about it. Maybe there will be a season 4. I think everyone at the studio and the network felt really good about where it ended.”\n\nIf"
