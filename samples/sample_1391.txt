We do not know if they will ever agree," he said.\n\n"It may not happen today, it may not happen tomorrow, but it will happen because there is no alternative."\n\nSpanish shares and bonds were sold off following the vote. The main Ibex stock index was down nearly 1.5% and Spain's 10-year government bond yield rose slightly to 1.84%.\n\nMore on the Catalan crisis\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The consequences of Catalonia's vote\n\nUnder the Spanish constitution, the national parliament must be formally informed of a secessionist bid for a referendum to be legal, but Mr Rajoy said the vote was "a mere theatrical demonstration".\n\nA number of international leaders and organisations had called for the vote to be postponed.\n\nAfter the police were deployed, European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted: "For EU nothing changes. Spain remains our only interlocutor. I hope the Spanish government favours force of argument, not argument of force."\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he "firmly condemns" the violence, adding: "I call on the Spanish government to respect the rule of law and the Spanish constitution."\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption At least 300,000 people joined a union-led protest on Tuesday in Barcelona\n\nMr Puigdemont said he had a mandate to declare independence but the vote would give his government a stronger mandate.\n\nHe said: "We will call for a debate in parliament, where we have a majority, to reach an agreement to carry out a binding referendum."\n\nBut Prime Minister Rajoy said the referendum vote was illegitimate, describing it as a "serious attack on the rule of law".\n\n"We cannot accept, in a democratic society, the blatant violation of the law, of the rules of the game, that is taking place in Catalonia," he said.\n\nCatalonia's government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part in the referendum, about 90% were in favour of independence. But anti-independence activists boycotted the vote.\n\nCatalonia is is one of Spain's richest, most distinctive regions, with a culture dating back to the early Middle Ages.\n\nBut many Catalans believe they pay more to Madrid than they get back, and there are historical grievances too, in particular Catalonia's treatment under the dictatorship of General Franco.
