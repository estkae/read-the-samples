Radar To New Bedford Inches Closer\n\nOver the past few months, John Cimini, owner of XBIX Inc., has been putting the finishing touches on a plan to bring XBIX-TV, a 24-hour all-movie channel, to New Bedford and the Tri-County area.\n\nNEW BEDFORD â€” The start of a new television station is getting closer.\n\n``This is a dream I've had for many years, but I've never been able to do anything about it,'' he said. ``I started this project a year ago, and we're almost at the end of the tunnel.''\n\nA 1980 New Bedford High School graduate, Cimini said he's had the idea for an all-movie channel since childhood. ``I used to love watching the movies on Channel 22 (WPRI) and channel 20 (WNAC). So when Channel 22 went off the air, I thought, `I could do this,''' he said.\n\nCimini said he was sure it would be a hit. ``It seems there are a lot of people who like the movies and don't have anything to do on a Saturday night but watch the same four or five movies.''\n\nCimini worked with several firms before settling on Global Video as his programmer. He said Global Video owns an extensive library of old movies, including some that aren't even out on video.\n\n``The movies we pick are good. They're not just movies that are out on video,'' he said.\n\nWith the programming, Cimini said, he wants to create a new ``golden era'' of TV programming. He said the channel would be the equivalent of a trip back in time to the TV of the 1960s and '70s, when the three major networks aired shows like ``Bonanza,'' ``Dragnet'' and ``Mission Impossible.''\n\nThe channel will also show movies from the 1980s, but there will be a bigger emphasis on older films. Cimini said XBIX-TV will also show two newer movies in addition to older movies.\n\n``The new movies will be really new,'' he said. ``There will be more recent stuff from 2000 or 2001.''\n\nIn addition, the channel will show some news and sports, as well as cartoons.\n\nCimini said XBIX-TV would operate like the ABC and CBS stations do. Programming would be provided by Global Video. The station would be local, showing local ads and having a local staff.\n\nCimini said the channel's mission would be to create jobs and help local charities.\n\n``The channel will also help local charities. For every hour of programming we put on, we'll give $1 for a good cause,'' he said. ``We're not saying which charities yet.''\n\nCimini said he also plans to put some of the station's proceeds into a charitable fund for the station's employees.
