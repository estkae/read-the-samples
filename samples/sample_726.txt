"A high school gym teacher from McDonough, Georgia has been arrested for an alleged sexual relationship with a female student.\n\nEverett Lee Compton, 27, of McDonough, was arrested by police in Henry County, Georgia on April 8 on one count of sexual assault against a person in custody, one count of sexual assault by a person with supervisory or disciplinary authority, and one count of sexual assault by a person in a position of trust or authority, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nThe student at Henry County High School reported the relationship to police after her parents caught her exchanging explicit photos with Compton, who she said had “started” her “on fire for God.”\n\n“I’ve never seen her like this,” the student’s mother said, “I don’t even know who this is.”\n\n“I know you said you love him and all that,” the girl’s mother told her, “but he’s a teacher.”\n\nThe mother told police that she confronted the teacher over text message, which is how they first learned about the relationship, but Compton denied the relationship.\n\n“I’m going to ask you to do something for me,” he wrote in a text message. “I’m not saying it didn’t happen but let me handle this my way.”\n\nThe student reportedly told police that she and Compton met at her father’s home, where the two smoked marijuana.\n\n“I felt sick to my stomach,” the student’s mother told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “I kept trying to tell myself that it was a student who had a crush on him, but when it came out that they smoked marijuana together, that’s when I knew something inappropriate was going on.”\n\n“This has destroyed my daughter,” she added.\n\nCompton was booked into the Henry County Jail on April 8, where he remains as of April 10.\n\nHis arrest comes just a month after 27-year-old Brittany Zamora, a teacher at Las Brisas Academy Elementary School in El Paso, Texas, was arrested and charged with three counts of sexual assault of a child and three counts of improper relationship with a student.\n\nZamora is accused of having a sexual relationship with an eighth-grade student, who told police that she and Zamora had kissed on two occasions, and that Zamora had touched her breast on another occasion.\n\nAccording to police, Zamora also admitted to having had sex with the student on a bed in her apartment, but claims the student was the one who initiated it.\n\n“The child told her that she wanted to have sex with her, and she knew it was wrong, but did it anyway,” El Paso police said in a press release, adding that Zamora later admitted to exchanging inappropriate texts with the student.\n\nZamora is currently out on bond, and has been placed on paid administrative leave.
