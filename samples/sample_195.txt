Rated 5 out of 5 by Bullockie79 from The only thing better than this shirt is the price I’m a bigger guy and I like to buy shirts that fit my body. This shirt is long enough in the body and the sleeves, so the shirt fits properly. I’m very pleased with the weight of the shirt. It’s not too heavy. So I don’t get too hot.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by kramer from great product This is the second shirt I have purchased in this style. I wear them almost every day and wash them many times. They are very durable.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by JJG1 from Great shirt Great shirts. Great quality and material. Washes great and hangs out on the line to dry. Great with the Carhartt suspenders.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Bihangir from Fantastic! Awesome product, awesome quality. Will buy more for sure.
