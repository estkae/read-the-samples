"The White House declined on Wednesday to confirm whether it believes the Iran nuclear agreement was legally binding, the latest in a series of clarifications made after the White House found itself mired in confusion over its own stance.\n\n"You're free to call it whatever you want," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said when asked about the administration's stance on the deal.\n\nThe response is the latest in a string of similar comments made by officials after the White House found itself mired in confusion last week over its stance on the deal.\n\nIn the past week, the White House has said the deal is binding, that it's not binding and that it's dependent on Iran's behavior.\n\nOn Tuesday, Secretary of State John Kerry referred to the deal as a "political commitment."\n\nEarnest, meanwhile, maintained on Wednesday that it is "indisputable" that Iran is in compliance with the agreement.\n\n“Our view has been clear, and has been consistent from the beginning: The way that you judge the success of this deal is by its results,” he said. “It’s indisputable that the international community, including the IAEA, has a much better understanding today of the scope of Iran’s nuclear program than they did before the deal was negotiated. And in that context, there is no evidence that they have been in material breach of the deal.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Earnest said the U.S. was committed to the "the deal’s successful implementation."\n\nAnd last week, he said the deal was "binding" and that the U.S. has a "pretty good idea" that Iran is not in violation of its commitments.\n\nBut just a few days earlier, another White House spokesman said it was not a binding agreement and that it was up to Iran to prove it was in compliance.
