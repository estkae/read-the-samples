"My self-summary\n\nMy goal in life is to experience as much as possible while on this planet. I love to read, cook, try new foods, spend time in the sun, relax and laugh.\n\n\n\nI am a quirky and unique individual. Some would say that I am one of a kind. I believe I am not afraid to take risks and I am unafraid to speak my mind.\n\n\n\nI love to travel and explore the world. I am very spontaneous and enjoy taking the road less traveled. I would love to meet someone who shares these same interests and values.\n\n\n\nI have a great sense of humor and can laugh at myself. I also have a very sarcastic and dry sense of humor. It takes someone who can appreciate my personality to keep up with me.\n\n\n\nI am kind, caring, and very compassionate. I am also intelligent and know what it takes to make me happy. I am not into drama and am looking for a relationship that is not full of games.
