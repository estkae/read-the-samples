"Coordinates:\n\nThe Haystack Mountain School of Crafts was established in 1937, in the town of Deer Isle, Maine, USA. Originally a summer school, it was established by a small group of craftspeople including George Elbert Burr, Ernest N. Griggs, Bernard Leach, Francis D. and Irene Castle, Charles Keck, Samuel Hubbard, Eugene Savage, and others. In 1970, it became a year-round institution. In 1971, the Haystack Graduate School of Fine Arts was established.[1]\n\nHaystack hosts a variety of adult and youth workshops throughout the year on jewelry making, sculpture, glassblowing, blacksmithing, woodworking, ceramics, photography, bookbinding, and metalsmithing.\n\nHaystack operates an intern program during the school year, and an exchange program during the summer. There is a low-cost, on-site dormitory for year-round students.\n\nIn 2007, Haystack's main building burned to the ground. Haystack lost all of its facilities and began the construction of a new building on the same site, based on the original designs.
