Filmmaker Luc Besson is in talks with Warner Bros. to direct and produce a new version of "Logan's Run."\n\nBesson is currently at work on a sci-fi project at EuropaCorp. In 2015, the studio teamed with Beijing-based Huahua Media to co-produce films, including an adaptation of the Chinese novel "Tiny Times" that starred Fan Bingbing, Zhang Ziyi and Wang Chuanjun.\n\nBesson and his wife and producing partner, Virginie Silla, would produce "Logan's Run."\n\nThe 1976 film, based on the 1967 novel by William F. Nolan and George Clayton Johnson, followed Logan 5, a "sandman" whose job is to track down and kill everyone who tries to escape their society's mandatory death sentence when they reach 21.\n\nIn the movie, he meets a woman named Jessica who leads him on a perilous journey through the bowels of the city.\n\n"Logan's Run" spawned a sequel, "Logan's Run: Logan's Journey," but it was not based on Nolan's or Johnson's work.\n\nWarner Bros. did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNews was first reported by Deadline Hollywood.
