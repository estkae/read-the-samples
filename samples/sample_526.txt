Sri Lankan cricket team in Australia in 2014–15\n\nThe Sri Lanka national cricket team toured Australia from 10 December 2014 to 4 January 2015. The tour consisted of two Twenty20 International (T20I) matches, three One Day International (ODI) matches and two Test matches. The T20I matches were played in Hobart on 14 and 16 December 2014, the ODI matches were played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) from 26 to 28 December 2014, and the Test matches were played at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) from 2 to 6 January 2015.\n\nIn July 2014, Sri Lanka Cricket named a preliminary 26-man squad for the tour. This was later reduced to 23.\n\nOn the first T20I of the series, Tillekaratne Dilshan scored the fastest fifty in T20I history off just 13 balls.\n\nThe first ODI of the series was the 400th ODI match to be held at the MCG.\n\nThe first Test of the series saw the return of Australian all-rounder Shane Watson after injury.\n\nSri Lanka won the Test series 2–0 and therefore won the Chappell–Hadlee Trophy.\n\n
