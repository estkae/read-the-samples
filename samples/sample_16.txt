I don't think it is your attitude. I think it is just the way you are.\n\nIt isn't a criticism, just a statement of fact. It's like saying I don't think you are stupid.\n\nJust that you are naive, sweet, guileless, open. You have so much going for you, you don't have to be cynical.\n\nBut it isn't fair to the rest of us, not fair to expect us to feel your innocence and not to respond to it.\n\nYou need to toughen up, otherwise you will just be hurt. But don't ever be cynical.
