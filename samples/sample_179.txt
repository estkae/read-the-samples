Sesalpinia\n\nSesalpinia is a genus of flowering plants in the pea family, Fabaceae. The genus is native to the Americas, where it is distributed from the southern United States (Florida, Texas) to the northernmost part of Argentina (Tucum√°n). Species are known by many common names, including crown-peas, princess flower, Barbados pride, guizotia, maua, grama grass, whitetick, sandburs, Mexican ticks, pinquitos, piquitos, barbas de Indias, and zorillo.\n\nThe species of "Sesalpinia" are annual or perennial herbaceous vines, often with a woody base, reaching a height of 3 m. Leaves are bipinnate or tripinnate, made up of 10-30 leaflets, often with reddish margins. Flowers are in racemes, and are usually white to pink, though yellow and lavender flowers are known. The fruit is a pod, often with a distinctive hooked beak.\n\nThe genus is currently classified in the subfamily Mimosoideae, but the taxonomy is in need of a comprehensive phylogenetic study. The five species that have been traditionally recognized in "Sesalpinia" are not monophyletic. While the closest relatives of the genus are in the tribe Ingeae in subfamily Mimosoideae, "Sesalpinia" is not most closely related to any of the genera in that tribe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
