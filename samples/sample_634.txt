"Fans of Erstwhile Records can look forward to a host of new releases coming out this month, including L’appel du Vide, a new album by saxophonist Kjetil Møster, who was part of Erstwhile’s first wave of releases in 2005 and has since built a formidable international career as a creative saxophonist.\n\nAlong with Møster’s new album, Erstwhile will release a double CD by John Butcher’s Stillpoint Orchestra, the first album by Fórn, a new album by guitarist Andrea Neumann, and a new trio album by Heterotic (Tetsu Saitoh on electric guitar, Robin Hayward on bass, and Chris Corsano on drums).\n\nBe sure to also catch Erstwhile artists at this year’s edition of Incubate in Tilburg, the Netherlands.
