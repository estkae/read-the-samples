Matt Drudge, the founder and editor of the Drudge Report, suggested Monday that President Trump will likely use Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election as an excuse to fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions and shut down the Russia probe.\n\nThe Drudge Report, a conservative news aggregator, splashed a headline at the top of its site Monday that said, “MUELLER INDICTS PRESIDENT.”\n\nThe headline linked to a New York Post story that said that the special counsel’s report to the Justice Department could include an indictment of Trump.\n\nDOJ sources say the Mueller Report will likely not be good for President Trump… they also say the Mueller Report will likely not be good for President Trump… https://t.co/LcVlY5pQiP — MATT DRUDGE (@DRUDGE) October 22, 2018\n\nDrudge followed the New York Post link by posting on his Twitter account that the special counsel’s report will be bad for the president.\n\n“DOJ sources say the Mueller Report will likely not be good for President Trump… they also say the Mueller Report will likely not be good for President Trump…,” he tweeted.\n\nDrudge has long warned about Sessions, a former Alabama senator, who is a target of conservatives who believe he has not been tough enough on immigration.\n\nDrudge, who reportedly speaks to Trump frequently, posted a story in July about Sessions’ sagging popularity among Republicans and said that if Trump does not replace him, the president will face a “massive revolt” from his base.\n\nA number of congressional Republicans have voiced their support for Trump firing Sessions.\n\nWhile Drudge did not mention Sessions by name in his tweet Monday, it comes at a time when speculation about the attorney general’s fate is at a fever pitch.\n\nSessions’ fate has been a point of discussion for more than a year. Trump often criticizes Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, which led to the appointment of a special counsel.\n\nOn Sunday, Sessions fired back at Trump for his relentless criticisms.\n\n“While I am attorney general, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations,” he said in a statement.
