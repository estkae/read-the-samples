With all the confusion and noise in our lives, some would argue that success is being able to filter the signal from the noise. Well in the case of Social Media, that's becoming even harder to do.\n\nThe great Peter Brierley offers up an explanation.\n\nOne definition of the word "noise" is "unwanted sound". It is not uncommon to find people describing internet, TV, radio, newspaper, and magazine content as "noise". But this is too simplistic a view.\n\nAlthough social media can be treated as a one-way information broadcast medium, it is rarely the case that anything ever broadcasts uninterrupted. If a message does get through, it will normally be met with a response that is not necessarily a reply. These can be from people who like what they are hearing, who are not so sure, or who are totally against the message.\n\nFor those who love social media, there are great benefits to be had. For others, the noise gets in the way of their communications strategy, with some even going so far as to say that social media is useless.
