I can't believe it. Yesterday, I got a letter from Robert D'Orta, the writer who's suing Paramount for copyright infringement over the Star Trek reboot. He wants to settle. And I've got to say, my heart just jumped. A settlement means that Paramount's going to have to pay some kind of damages, and I get to share in it. Maybe I get a check, maybe I get some percentage of whatever they owe to Robert. I can't believe it. That one line. "Paramount's counsel has been in contact with me about settlement."It just keeps me going. It's the first time since this all started that I can say for sure that I'm not just some crazy person running after a scam. Robert D'Orta and I were going to be in the history books.I can't believe it. I'm really going to have to look at a settlement now. Who do I want? What's it going to take? What are the chances of me getting something from this?What's next?
