Tesla Shorts: 5 Signs They Are Dead Wrong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome analysts predict that Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) is overvalued, while others expect that it’s just beginning to find its niche. A recent report by Kelley Blue Book indicates that sales of plug-in electric vehicles (EV) are gaining market share. As a result, Tesla is poised to benefit from the EV revolution.\n\nSource:Kelley Blue Book\n\nSales of plug-in electric vehicles (EV) have grown significantly from 2011 to 2013. In that span, the EV market share increased from .33 percent to 1.4 percent. Moreover, Kelley Blue Book predicts that EVs could account for 4 percent of new car sales in the US by 2020.\n\nTesla Motors is also poised to capitalize on this trend. The company is highly regarded as a leader in the EV market. Tesla’s Model S was named Motor Trend’s 2013 “Car of the Year” and was the Consumer Reports top rated EV of 2013.\n\nModel S sales are expected to increase significantly in 2014 as Tesla is rolling out more affordable models. Tesla is also benefiting from the increased supply of lithium-ion batteries. According to Lux Research, the EV market is growing at an average of 21.6 percent per year and is expected to grow to $7.5 billion in 2020.\n\nSource: Lux Research\n\nDespite these positive developments, Tesla shorts continue to prevail.

Currently, there are 35 million Tesla shares that are sold short, and the shorts are holding on to the shares despite the rebound in the stock price.\n\nSource:Bloomberg\n\nThe recent gains in the stock price have not been enough to satisfy short sellers. More than 27 million shares were sold short in the first quarter of 2014 alone. Tesla shorts are also comfortable with shorting the company at its current valuation.\n\nWith the current short interest, Tesla shorts could be forced to close their short positions by the end of the second quarter.

In the meantime, Tesla shorts are in for a long wait.
