It's been a long week.\n\n"It was only my second year so I didn't expect to win it."\n\nTicktum said he had a brake problem at the start.\n\n"I had a bad start and then the pedal went to the floor halfway round the first lap," he said.\n\n"It was a tough race to come from ninth to finish third.\n\n"It's been a brilliant week. I didn't come last year so I was a bit disappointed with that but I've won the Jack Sears Trophy.\n\n"I'd like to thank Tony Gilham Racing and Arden for this opportunity."\n\nMaldonado, the youngest driver in the field, was happy with his third place.\n\n"I tried to get away but couldn't," he said.\n\n"We were trying to get the championship but that wasn't possible but we've still won the fair play award and my target was to finish on the podium.\n\n"I'm happy with that."\n\nFourth was the TRS Arden car of Callan O'Keeffe, with team-mate Enaam Ahmed fifth.\n\nO'Keeffe said: "I did all I could in the race but I couldn't do more than fourth.\n\n"I gave it my all and got the points."
