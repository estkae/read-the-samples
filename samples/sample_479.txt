Beauty\n\nI came across this article in Style Magazine about Kim Kardashian being named a rising star by Teen Vogue. Really?! Kim Kardashian is being compared to Audrey Hepburn, and Grace Kelly? I am not quite sure what Teen Vogue was thinking, but this makes me think they are more concerned about the bottom line of a magazine than really focusing on their readers and what they want to read about. What kind of beauty standards does Teen Vogue endorse?
