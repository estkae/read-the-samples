[SI-LIST] Re: Some more responses on DAI\n\nI just got my FPGA design up and running and I'm not sure what is\n\nwrong. I'm working with an Altera 2500 series FPGA and have a PCI\n\nstandard PCI bridge design.\n\n\n\nHere's what I'm trying to do:\n\n\n\n1. If I have the PCI bus pulled high to the 3.3v supply, the bus\n\ndoesn't work, obviously.\n\n\n\n2. If I put the 3.3v high impedance power up, the bus doesn't work.\n\n\n\n3. If I put the 3.3v up and the pull the bus low (no connect on the\n\nPCI pins) the bus doesn't work.\n\n\n\nThe reason I'm going for this is because I have a great PCI\n\nbridge design that I want to use and I don't want to re-implement\n\nit.\n\n\n\nIs there something I'm missing here?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nRyan Kahl\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe best anti-spam money can buy.
