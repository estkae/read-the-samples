Hibiscus Tea, Just For You!\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you ever wanted a Hibiscus Tea gift basket? We did. So we created one. With a good assortment of Hibiscus Tea. Some of our favorites and some you may have never heard of before. The possibilities of tea are endless and that is why we just can't seem to get enough of it!\n\n\n\nHibiscus tea has been around for centuries, but it wasn't until it began to show up in the United States in the last few decades that it has really become popular. The plant that it comes from is native to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. This wonderful and delicious tea was said to be a favorite of Don Carlos, King of Spain, in the 16th Century.\n\n\n\nThe flavor of the tea depends on how it is prepared. There are a few different ways to brew this tea, from its basic form of dried petals, to the more complex methods like a floral infusion.\n\n\n\nYou can make a simple Hibiscus tea by placing 1 tablespoon of dried Hibiscus flowers into a tea infuser and steeping for about five minutes. If you would like a cold version, then you can mix the dried Hibiscus flowers with water and let it steep overnight. Then put the liquid in the refrigerator until it is cold. Another way to enjoy a cold Hibiscus tea is to use a commercial version, such as our Hibiscus Lemonade Tea.\n\n\n\nThere are different ways to make a floral infusion. To make a floral infusion, place 1 tablespoon of dried Hibiscus flowers and 2 cups of hot water into a quart jar. Let it steep for 10-15 minutes and then strain it. Hibiscus tea is delicious on its own, but you can also add a little bit of sugar and lime juice to the infusion.\n\n\n\nThe tea can be consumed either hot or cold. There is no right or wrong way to drink Hibiscus tea. You can make a basic infusion and let it steep overnight, or you can make a more complex floral infusion, or you can just make a basic cold infusion. No matter what your preference, you will find that this tea is quite delicious.\n\nNote: this is a customer favorite, we'll take a 12 pack!
