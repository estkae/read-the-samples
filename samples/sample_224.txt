\n\nSenator KROGER (Minister for Population and Immigration) (10:46 AM) —I seek leave to make a short statement.\n\n\n\nThe PRESIDENT —Leave is granted for one minute.\n\n\n\nSenator KROGER —The Leader of the Opposition indicated yesterday that he would be referring to the legal framework in relation to the privatisation of Telstra. This is not surprising given that the issue of Telstra was discussed at the last election and he has been a long-time supporter of privatisation.\n\nIt is interesting to note, though, that it is the opposition who have failed to produce their privatisation plan—not that they have one. And they have failed to produce it for one simple reason: it will have to meet with the ACCC guidelines in relation to Telstra. I was very happy to provide those guidelines to the opposition. I can provide them again this morning if they want.\n\n\n\nSenator Campbell —We know you are the legal supremo.\n\n\n\nThe PRESIDENT —Senator Krueger, on your own account, to get a bit of latitude—I think you have five minutes now.\n\n\n\nSenator KROGER —Thank you, Mr President. What I can do is provide them again this morning, but if the opposition has the same rhetoric it has used at the last election—and I know it is used at every election by the leader of the opposition—then it will fail to have its proposal examined in any great detail by the ACCC. It is not because we have an axe to grind, it is because the opposition have an axe to grind. But it does not pass the ACCC test, and it is interesting that they do not want to have that detailed examination of their proposal.\n\nLet us have a look at what Telstra said yesterday. The headline, of course, in the Australian Financial Review is ‘Telstra asks regulator to speed up broadband overhaul’. You would be very happy about that, Senator, wouldn’t you?\n\n\n\nSenator Campbell —We are.\n\n\n\nSenator KROGER —The point is that you have not said what the rates are. But if you had done your job in the last election and had produced your plan, then the ACCC would have had the option to have you examine your plan and to determine what the rates should be and whether they could be extended. What we have done is ensure that the interest of consumers and business in this country are protected. We have done it by putting in a position where the ACCC will have the opportunity to examine any privatisation proposal that the opposition has.\n\nAnd, Mr President, there are a number of aspects of Telstra that have been raised by the opposition. They are in the policy documents that the opposition are putting around. There is no doubt that those aspects of Telstra will be examined by the ACCC, as will be anything else they may have up their sleeve.
