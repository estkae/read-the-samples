Written by Andrew Pollard Thursday, 14 August 2014\n\nComics\n\nTwo of our favourite creative teams from across the pond are joining forces in a six issue mini-series for Image Comics and if you’re a fan of dark, intense crime stories then this one is right up your street.\n\nAs part of Image Expo in San Francisco last week, Brian K Vaughan and Marcos Martin announced that they would be teaming up once again, this time for a new mini-series entitled Barrier. The pair worked together previously on “Ex Machina”, a modern retelling of Frankenstein, which won them both Eisner Awards. That run is quite rightly regarded as a modern classic, but now they are going it alone again with a brand new story. The pair will also be joined on the series by Muntsa Vicente who will be colouring and lettering the book.\n\nSet in a dystopian future where the United States is now divided into two distinct nations, one of which is completely landlocked, Vaughan will pen the series, with Martin providing the art. In the story, a father attempts to cross a dangerous barrier to see his daughter. “It's a story about what it means to be a father and a man and a human being and it's a story about trying to do the right thing when everything goes wrong,” said Vaughan. “I've been so lucky to have worked with so many of the best artists of our generation, and Marcos is certainly one of them. This book is really going to be beautiful.”\n\nVaughan also praised the brilliance of his friend and collaborator, stating, “ Marcos' work on this book is really going to blow people away. It's a story that he and I really connected on and it's just going to look spectacular.”\n\nExpect to see “Barrier” arrive in stores in the second half of 2015.\n\nSHARE YOUR COMMENTS BELOW OR ON TWITTER @STARBURST_MAG\n\nFind your local STARBURST stockist HERE, or buy direct from us HERE.
