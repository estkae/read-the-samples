"You probably already know that you need a password to log in to your computer and the websites that you use. What you may not know is that these passwords are actually really weak. To make your passwords as strong as possible, use these tips and tools.\n\nDo Not Use Real Words\n\nThe first rule of creating passwords is not to use real words. This means that you should not use a sentence or a phrase that is easy for a hacker to guess. One way to make it harder for a hacker to guess your password is to use a few random letters and numbers to form a random word that no one would ever think of.\n\nExamples:\n\nFGHckjd\n\nSw3E17G\n\ncQ12byQj\n\nIf you are trying to remember your passwords, there are many programs that allow you to create a “pass phrase” which is a short series of words that you can easily remember and then be used to create a very strong password.\n\nUse Unique Passwords\n\nIt is very important to use a unique password for every website you use. There are many websites that allow you to have a single sign-on, but this means that hackers have access to all of your information at that one site. Instead, use unique passwords for every site that you use.\n\nDo Not Use Any Personal Information\n\nYou should never use any personal information in your passwords. This means that you should not use your name, your birthday, your kids’ names, or even your pet’s name in your passwords. Personal information is easy for a hacker to figure out and can cause you a lot of grief if your personal information is compromised.\n\nDo Not Rely on a Keypad\n\nYou should not rely on your keypad on your smartphone when creating passwords. There are many programs that can use your keypad to figure out what your password is. To avoid this, use an app that creates passwords. The random password will be stored in a database and you can access it later.\n\nUse Multi-Stage Passwords\n\nSome websites allow you to use a multi-stage password. These passwords have several stages where you have to enter a different password at each stage. An example would be a three-stage password: the first stage is “8,” the second stage is “5,” and the third stage is “1.”\n\nUse Unique Keys\n\nAnother way to make it harder for a hacker to break your password is to use a unique key on your device to create a strong password. Many browsers and operating systems allow you to use a master key to create a password. You can use a master key on your smartphone, tablet, or computer to create a very strong password.\n\nBe Careful When Logging In to Sites\n\nThe final thing you should do is to be careful when logging in to websites. Never click on a link in an email that seems suspicious. Instead, copy and paste the link into your browser. Make sure you know where a link goes before you click on it.
