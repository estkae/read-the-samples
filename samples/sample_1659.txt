Just noticed this on itunes while browsing.. If you're not too good with a controller it's the game you want. It's a 2D fighter and it's harder than dmc and sonic generations combined.It's worth checking out if you haven't.I'll post a link to some videos if anyone wants to see.\n\nHoly shit, I had the same thought when looking at it on my PC. This game is crazy hard. I could never get past the first fight, where you fight a bunch of like, 8 guys at the same time.But this guy went as far as to do the 100 fight challenge in a single sitting, where you have to fight 100 opponents in a row, no continues, in under 10 minutes:His own personal feat is the 100 Character Challenge, where you have to get to a character named Wagnas, and defeat him to get a trophy. This guy's also doing that one in a single sitting as well:They also have a "Co-op challenge" where you and a friend team up and beat all the challenges. It's hilarious watching them play that together:Another one of their challenges was a 40 minute full-screen final boss fight. To get a trophy, the guy in the video just kept pushing forward and moving back to dodge the attacks, as he knew the final boss wouldn't attack him. It's actually pretty amusing:\n\nSome interesting point and click adventure games you might like. The first one is more of a point and click classic, the second one is more of a horror/mystery game, the third one is more of a detective game (similar to Phoenix Wright).\n\nIt's worth noting that the author of the series, Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw (formerly Ben Croshaw), started out as a video game journalist.\n\nChrono Trigger (first sequel)\n\nShadow Hearts: Covenant\n\nShadow Hearts: From the New World\n\nOkami\n\nOne must wonder how he managed to turn this"
