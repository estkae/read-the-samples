The murder of the investigative journalist and two-time Academy Award winning filmmaker who was critical of Russian president Vladimir Putin, points to the fact that there is no independent journalism in Russia, Prof. Mark Galeotti, Senior Researcher at the Institute of International Relations Prague (Czech Republic) and an expert on Russian security services, has told Sputnik.\n\n© AP Photo / Evgeny Feldman Oligarchs Pushed Away From the Media, Facing Pressure From the Russian Authorities\n\nThe state-run Russian Investigative Committee has opened a criminal investigation into the murder of Boris Nemtsov , a Russian opposition politician, on charges of illegal arms trade.\n\nOn Sunday, February 28, Nemtsov was shot dead while walking across a bridge near the Kremlin in Moscow, on his way home.\n\n“Putin has silenced the few remaining independent newspapers and there is no independent television. If it weren’t for the internet, people would not have any information about what is going on,” Mark Galeotti, Senior Researcher at the Institute of International Relations Prague (Czech Republic) and an expert on Russian security services, told Sputnik.\n\nGaleotti pointed out that as Russia’s opposition leaders are being arrested or killed, the country’s media are totally “under the control of the Russian authorities.”\n\n“If you are critical of Putin, you are likely to disappear or be killed. There is no independent journalism,” he stressed.\n\nAt the same time, the academic stressed that “murder” should not be used in this case, as it is actually “a pre-meditated killing.”\n\n“It is a message to anybody else who might want to be critical, that there is no point in being outspoken,” Galeotti noted.\n\nSpeaking about the possible motives for Nemtsov’s murder, the academic suggested that there might have been a “spat” between the victim and the Russian authorities over the situation in Ukraine.\n\n“I can imagine that there was some sort of disagreement,” Galeotti said. “Nemtsov was an avowed liberal, who was pro-Western. He said that Putin’s policies in Ukraine were wrong.”\n\nThe Russian academic noted that Nemtsov could have been “brought into the public eye by some of the authorities who are opposed to Putin’s policies.”\n\n“I am not saying that Putin ordered the killing, but if you look at who is opposed to him, there are different people. Nemtsov was a figure of importance in the 1990s and in the early 2000s. So if you are trying to build up a coalition, you would bring Nemtsov back,” Galeotti noted.\n\nThe killing of Boris Nemtsov is “highly significant,” Galeotti said, adding that “not everybody is killed.”\n\n“The message is that there is no point in being outspoken. It is an effective silencer of anyone else who might want to be critical of the regime,” the academic concluded.
