"Russia remains the most dangerous place in the world for journalists, according to the latest edition of the international watchdog's Press Freedom Index.\n\nThe report from Reporters Without Borders (RSF) singled out the killing of investigative reporter Anna Politkovskaya, whose "barbaric murder" last year, carried out by "agents of the state", was symbolic of the decline of freedom of expression in Russia.\n\n"It was under Vladimir Putin that this decline became clear," RSF said, referring to the president's eight years in office.\n\n"Once Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested in 2003 and the media magnate Vladimir Gusinsky was forced to flee the country, the government was no longer constrained in its quest for self-preservation," RSF said.\n\nKhodorkovsky's arrest, along with the 2004 jailing of former nuclear power chief Yevgeny Adamov, marked "the beginning of a media crackdown aimed at creating a climate of fear that has lasted to this day."\n\nRSF pointed to an unprecedented number of journalists jailed in Russia in 2006. At least 10 were jailed in the wake of the November 2005 massacre of schoolchildren in the town of Beslan, including three for covering the aftermath of the hostage-taking.\n\nBut the watchdog said the root of the problem lies in the "paradox" that Russia has one of the world's freest media environments but that independent journalists are often threatened.\n\nIt warned that Russia's near-total control of the media, either directly or through a strong grip on business, gives "permission" to many people to attack journalists.\n\n"A state of anxiety"\n\nWhile the 2005 conviction of former Yukos CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the trial of pro-democracy activists in the so-called "Bolotnaya Square case" in early 2012 showed that criticism of the government can still be punishable, RSF said Russia is "in the grip of a veritable witch-hunt against media workers and their sources."\n\n"We're living in an era of secrecy, both governmental and corporate, which has encouraged people to spy on each other, including journalists," the report said.\n\nThe watchdog also pointed to the restrictive new law on NGOs adopted by Russia last year as a sign that "self-censorship is becoming a way of life" for media professionals in the country.\n\n"Journalists are scared, and have good reason to be. Too many of them are exposed to threats, some of which have proved to be fatal. A climate of fear reigns," RSF said.\n\nThe report said the 2008 launch of a government body to oversee and censor the media, the Federal Service for the Supervision of Communications, Information Technology, and Mass Media, was "proof of the excessive zeal of the authorities in their efforts to exercise control."\n\nThe situation was worse for journalists outside the capital, RSF said.\n\n"They have been the target of frequent beatings and kidnapping. In Chechnya, where the Chechen regime uses abductions and torture to force journalists to join the local media, the capital Grozny is now the most dangerous place in the country for media workers."\n\nThe latest edition of the report, now in its 12th year, is based on an assessment of press freedom in 199 countries, graded into one of five categories: good, satisfactory, problematic, bad and very bad.\n\nThe top three positions in the index were unchanged from last year.\n\nFinland, Norway and Netherlands were again in first, second and third place.\n\nThe bottom three positions went to Turkmenistan, North Korea and Eritrea.
