The Colorado Rockies are at it again. After the signing of the contract extension, the trade of Ubaldo Jimenez, and the contract extension of Troy Tulowitzki, the Rockies are reportedly ready to sign first baseman Justin Morneau to a three year deal worth about $12 million per season.\n\nMorneau is a .294 career hitter with 223 home runs and 637 RBIs. The only knock on him is his lack of durability. Morneau has played more than 120 games only once in his career. Last season, the seven-year Minnesota Twin and former American League MVP battled a number of injuries that led to him hitting .238 with 15 homers and 55 RBIs in only 101 games.
