Album Review\n\nThe slow-grinding, bellowing, mean-as-all-get-out tones of Mike Spruill's drumming as the spine of the two-drummer Gov't Mule help anchor the band's soulful grooves.

We went through some changes and came up with the Gov't Mule thing, which has been a fantastic career for me. It's definitely something that has exceeded my expectations. I've been very fortunate to play with a lot of great people, too."\n\nSpruill, in turn, has provided his extensive musical history with a master class in the art of Southern rock.
