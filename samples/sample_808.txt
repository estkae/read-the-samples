I needed a microwave for my RV. I knew I wanted one of the new style so I checked out the Walmart website to see what they had. I found this little gem. It had great reviews and was much cheaper than the ones they sell at the RV stores. I bought this model for $44.86. It works great! You can control the temperature and time for each setting. It heats stuff up super fast. It is nice and compact. It also looks good. I bought this one over the Nutone model because I liked the shape of it better and because of the longer warranty (1 year vs. 6 months). The one I bought is stainless steel. The one they sell in stores is black. The manual is kind of flimsy. You don't really need it. The control panel is all touch so you just touch the options on the touch screen. It takes a little getting used to but not bad at all. Overall, I am very pleased with this microwave. If you need a small microwave and don't want to spend a lot of money, you should buy this one.
