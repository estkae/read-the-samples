Chrome 45 was recently released and is available for users on Windows, Mac, Linux, Chrome OS, Android, and iOS. This version of Chrome brings the much awaited Chrome Custom Tabs which is an API that allows developers to use Chrome's UI and navigation for their app. The API is available for iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and Chrome OS.\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers can also use the same SDK to build their own web-based Chrome Custom Tabs. To do so, they need to use the tabs.create API. This allows apps to build their own custom tabs using web content. When a user opens an URL, the Chrome Custom Tab is displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Windows, the developer mode for this API is turned on by default. While this is a great feature for developers, it could be an issue for users who do not want an extra browser window opened in the background.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can disable this by going to the Chrome browser Settings, and selecting the Advanced tab. Here, you can disable the "Allow running app code on startup" feature, and click on Relaunch Chrome.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more details, visit the source page below:\n\n\n\n
