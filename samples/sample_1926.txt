\n\n\n\nOur products are made from solid wood, but you can't tell by looking at them! We are taking a new direction in the way we make our products. Solid wood is the key! This means that every joint is glued and reinforced with dowels and no small nails or screws are used. You'll get the benefits of the wood, such as a better grip, but won't have to worry about the downsides of nails or screws. No worry about the wood splitting, no concern about tiny nails that might come loose, and you won't have to struggle with tiny screws.\n\n\n\n\n\nReclaimed Wood\n\n\n\nWe are one of only a handful of companies that actually buy reclaimed lumber from the saw mill! The lumber is in rough shape, but we can make it look good. We don't sell reclaimed lumber in our Etsy shop, but you can contact us and get a special price.\n\n\n\n\n\nDimensions\n\n\n\nWe can make any of our products in any size you want. There are standard sizes for our products, but if you are making a custom order we'll be happy to accommodate. We'll need to have the details for your design before we can give you a quote.\n\n\n\n\n\nLaser Engraved Designs\n\n\n\nOur laser engraved designs are designed with great care. All of the designs were made by hand, and can be tweaked to suit your needs. We offer logos, portraits, landscapes, script, and even sayings.\n\n\n\n\n\nShipping\n\n\n\nWe use USPS Priority Mail for most of our orders. Some large items, such as jewelry box sets and cedar chests will be sent via FedEx Ground. All orders will be shipped in a shipping box, which means that the products won't get damaged during transit. We always insure packages so you can rest assured that they will arrive safely.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen will my order arrive?\n\n\n\nTypically, we ship within 2-3 business days of receiving an order. In most cases, the package will arrive to you in 3-5 business days after it's been shipped.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave questions?\n\n\n\nSend us a convo or an email! We are happy to help!
