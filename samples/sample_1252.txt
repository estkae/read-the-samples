Why are you looking at the stars\n\nwhen you’ve got a wonderful person in front of you?\n\nThey are beautiful.\n\nThey are a part of you.\n\nBut they’re stars.\n\nStarry eyed, you watch them;\n\nSparkling with energy.\n\nYou wish on them,\n\nDream on them,\n\nDreams you know you can’t fulfill,\n\nnot from here.\n\nWhy are you looking at the stars?\n\nYou’re in the middle of the most beautiful thing\n\nyou’ve ever seen.\n\nWhy are you looking at the stars?\n\nWhy are you looking at the stars?\n\n~\n\n(Image: via Google)\n\nAdvertisements
