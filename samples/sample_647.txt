"Yogapedia explains Hip-Hop\n\nHip-hop is a genre of music that became popular in the late 1970s and is associated with the hip-hop culture that evolved from DJing, MCing and breakdancing. The term hip-hop was coined in the late 1970s by Bronx DJ Afrika Bambaataa, and a few years later by hip-hop journalist and rapper Fab Five Freddy.\n\nHip-hop involves four major components: DJing, MCing, graffiti and breakdancing. The term is also used as a catch-all phrase to describe other styles of music that may not fit any other genres.\n\nMany people who were hip-hop DJs began as b-boys or breakdancers. As the genre became more commercialized in the 1980s and 1990s, the breakdancers and graffiti artists were less able to make a living from their craft and moved on to other occupations. Many popular DJs from the late 1970s and early 1980s were, or became, also graffiti artists and b-boys, including Afrika Bambaataa, Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five, Cold Crush Brothers, Tuff Crew, Roxanne Shante, Fab 5 Freddy, DJ Jazzy Jay, Cash Money, DJ Easy Lee, Kurtis Blow and Run-D.M.C.
