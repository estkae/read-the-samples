This week, we have taken a close look at the state of the self-driving car industry in the United States and what challenges it still faces.\n\nOn Wednesday, we discussed how there was a gap in the regulatory framework that governs self-driving cars and how this could impede the development of the technology. On Thursday, we looked at how self-driving car companies should focus on deploying vehicles as opposed to just testing them on roads.\n\nToday, we will focus on what effect self-driving cars could have on auto insurance and how the industry can adapt to the changing landscape.\n\nAs technology develops, auto insurance companies will have to adapt. We're already seeing the effects of autonomous vehicles on insurance, but it's not all bad. In fact, the technology could have a positive effect on auto insurance.\n\nRead on to learn more.\n\nDecreasing Accident Rates and Claims\n\nOne of the biggest selling points for self-driving cars is that they could make roads safer. With cars that have the ability to sense their surroundings and react accordingly, fewer accidents should occur.\n\nAnd as more self-driving cars are put on the road, there will be fewer accidents involving human error.\n\nIf the technology is implemented successfully, the rate of accidents on the road could go down. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reports that from 2011 to 2015, the rate of fatal accidents dropped by 40 percent.\n\nReducing the amount of accidents on the road should result in a decrease in the number of auto insurance claims. But the question is, how much?\n\nReducing Claims Costs\n\nAccording to The Economist, the introduction of self-driving cars could lead to a decrease in the number of crashes by 90 percent. But that could lead to a reduction in auto insurance claims by just 50 percent.\n\nWhile that might sound like a lot, it could be a huge benefit to auto insurance companies. Instead of having to pay out $212 billion a year, the industry could save about half of that.\n\nThat means that auto insurance companies could turn their focus to other areas. For instance, the introduction of self-driving cars could allow companies to eliminate physical damage coverage from their policies. The cost of premiums could also go down, and that means insurance companies would have more money available to give back to policyholders.\n\nBut the real savings could come from those who aren't covered by auto insurance. If self-driving cars do end up getting on the road by 2020, as some companies are claiming, then millions of Americans could become shut out of the insurance market. That could lead to a decrease in claims costs of 30 to 50 percent, which could have a huge impact on the bottom line of insurance companies.\n\nWhat Auto Insurance Companies Could Do\n\nThe report from The Economist also predicted that there would be a shakeout in the auto insurance industry. Companies that focus on insuring older drivers would have a hard time competing with those that specialize in underwriting the young and the safe. That could lead to consolidation and lower premiums.\n\nThat shakeout could mean that some auto insurance companies would adapt and begin writing policies for self-driving car owners. The technology is already here, and if auto insurance companies are willing to change with the times, then they could benefit from the new market.\n\nSome states have already begun preparing for this change. In New York, for example, the state's Department of Financial Services proposed regulations that would allow for the operation of self-driving cars. In addition to licensing vehicles, the state will also begin the process of licensing drivers.\n\nNew Opportunities for Insurers\n\nThe potential shakeout in the insurance industry might not all be bad. While some companies might fail, new opportunities could be created for those that stay in business.\n\nSelf-driving cars could allow insurers to offer specialized products, such as telematics-based policies that allow cars to report how they are being driven. That data can then be used to adjust premiums based on how safe a driver is.\n\nOther companies might look at using self-driving cars for transporting goods and people, which could allow for new revenue streams. Uber and Lyft could see the biggest changes, as companies like Progressive and Allstate could take over insuring the cars they use to move around passengers.\n\nPreparing for a New Market\n\nWhile many things still need to be worked out with regard to self-driving cars, the technology will soon be coming to market. The question is, how will insurance companies respond?\n\nOne thing that is for sure is that the future of auto insurance will be different. And auto insurance companies will have to find a way to compete in the new market.\n\nIt's going to be an exciting time for the industry. If it isn't prepared for the changes ahead, then it could find itself becoming irrelevant. But those that adapt could be the ones that come out on top.
