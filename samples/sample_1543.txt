The reason that it's not done, the reason that they have such a low education level, is because there is no legislation allowing women to go and work in the private sector.\n\n"Women's education is important because they are not allowed to work in the private sector, and if they can't work in the private sector, then they can't get an education," she says.\n\n'Domestic violence'\n\nIf the current legal framework is in need of reform, then the treatment of the victim in the eyes of the law is a key problem.\n\nWomen's rights groups here say there is a lack of respect for women and a stigma surrounding their treatment at the hands of the state\n\n"Victims of violence are very afraid to come forward and seek help because of the shame that they feel that they have," says Ms Saeed.\n\nShe describes the perception of the victim, often at the hands of her husband, as "shaming the family, and you are bringing the family to shame".\n\n"So the women themselves don't want to come forward, and they don't want to report," she says.\n\nThe attitude of the judiciary towards the victim is an important factor in preventing women from coming forward, says Ms Saeed.\n\n"The judiciary does not encourage women to come forward, in fact they discourage women from doing so.\n\n"It doesn't happen every time, but it does happen often, and it's because the judiciary itself doesn't understand what's going on," she says.\n\nReligious law\n\nShe believes the separation of the different courts is a cause of concern.\n\n"In one case you have a criminal case and you have to try it in the criminal court, but if it's a divorce case then it has to go to a different court. It's all this separate courts thing."\n\nIn Iraq's transitional justice system, there are now specialised courts for crimes against"
