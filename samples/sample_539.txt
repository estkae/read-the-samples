I have an icon on my page that will take you to a YouTube video. I've been using a width of 275px for this icon. It's a landscape image.\n\nhttp://www.glasscouncil.org/podcasts\n\nI wanted to change the text and make it smaller (10px is currently too small for the text to be read clearly.) The 275px width won't work for the text, but the 220px width doesn't work either. When I change the width to 220px the entire image goes off the side of the screen.\n\nHow do I maintain the current 275px width and make the text smaller without distorting the image?
