The general consensus in psychology is that intelligence is a singular entity that can be measured and is unchangeable, and that any issues with intelligence will remain constant throughout a person’s life.\n\n\n\nIn general, the accepted view of intelligence is based on a series of experiments carried out in the 1940s and 50s, commonly referred to as the IQ tests. These intelligence tests measured intelligence by identifying patterns and memory, and tested mental agility. But the modern view of intelligence is much broader, and focuses on a person’s ability to learn and their capacity to understand their environment.\n\n\n\nResearch carried out by a group of psychologists in New York have challenged the accepted view, and shown that people’s IQ levels do not necessarily remain the same throughout their lives.\n\n\n\nThey found that if a person has an early traumatic experience, then the level of intelligence is likely to reduce significantly.\n\nThe study\n\nThe study used a database of IQ scores for each person, which was then divided into three groups: people who were not exposed to early trauma, people who had experienced trauma before they were 18 and people who had experienced trauma before they were 16.\n\n\n\nThe study then looked at how the group with early trauma had scored after 16 years. What they found was that people who experienced trauma before the age of 16 scored lower on intelligence tests at the age of 30. Those who experienced trauma before they were 18 scored even lower than those who were traumatized before they were 16.\n\n\n\nThey also found that the difference between the group who experienced trauma and those who did not was three to five points, which is a significant amount.\n\n\n\nThese findings highlight the importance of understanding trauma and how it can affect people throughout their lives. It also shows that traumatic events can influence how a person learns and that this will have a lasting impact on their lives.\n\n\n\nThe other important thing to note from this study is that the effect of trauma was found to last for 20 years. Even though trauma had occurred so early in a person’s"
