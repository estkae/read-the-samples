Jerry Storch\n\nGerald N. "Jerry" Storch is a businessman who served as president and chief executive officer of Macy's Inc. from August 2011 until June 2017.\n\nStorch was born to a Jewish family in Manhattan. He is the son of Linda S. (n√©e Reiss) and Robert Storch. Storch has two brothers, David and Richard. His father was the CEO of Gimbels department store. Storch attended The Dwight School in New York City, graduating in 1973. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Williams College in 1978, where he was a member of the Theta Chi Fraternity. He went on to earn an M.B.A. from Columbia Business School in 1982.\n\nStorch joined Bloomingdale's in 1980. He has been the president of Saks since February 2000 and became its CEO in November 2001.\n\nStorch's two biggest ideas at Saks have been Saks OFF 5th, a discount offshoot of the brand, and "The Shop at Saks," a ground-floor boutique on Fifth Avenue in New York City.\n\nOn March 2, 2011, it was reported that Storch would be leaving Saks Fifth Avenue to become CEO of Macy's, replacing Terry Lundgren, who is staying at the company as chairman.\n\nStorch was named as president and CEO of Macy's on July 28, 2011, and assumed office on August 4, 2011. In January 2012, Storch introduced the New York concept to the Minneapolis-based department store chain.\n\nOn March 6, 2012, Storch led the Macy's presentation to department store and specialty store investors in New York City. The presentation included more details about Storch's efforts to revitalize Macy's and his plan to roll out a loyalty program throughout the Macy's stores.\n\nStorch's tenure was marked by both a strong market share and a commitment to growing the online business. In early 2016, Storch negotiated a long-term deal with Amazon to improve the online shopping experience for customers and to allow Amazon to handle some of Macy's most popular brands like Levi's, Disney, and Ugg. However, the market share increase came at a cost of earnings, which dropped from 2014 to 2016. This was in part due to a commitment to sprucing up the in-store shopping experience by adding more services like tailors and restaurants, as well as the cost of opening new stores and closing underperforming ones. On March 13, 2017, Macy's announced that Storch was stepping down from the company.\n\nStorch was one of five executives who appeared on "The Oprah Winfrey Show" on September 26, 2009, to discuss the "Buy American" phenomenon.
