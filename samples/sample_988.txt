Once a home in this gated HOA was worth about $800K. Now itâ€™s valued at $400K. - Stephanie Yao Long/Marketplace\n\nListen To The Story Marketplace Embed Code <iframe src="https://www.marketplace.org/2012/09/24/economy/troubled-times-investing-down-market/popout" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="240px"></iframe>\n\nStephanie Yao Long: There are many stories to tell about the housing market in this region.\n\nHome values are down, the economy is still recovering. One story is of an 18-year-old couple who bought their first house. One morning, 18-year-old Christin and her husband Matthew woke up, and a sheriff was at the front door. They had fallen behind on their mortgage payments. The bank foreclosed on their home.\n\nI asked Christin what that day was like.\n\nChristin: You don't know how to react to it. It's just one of those things that happened. I guess it's all how you deal with it after that, I guess.\n\nBut in the end, Christin and Matthew were able to stay in the home -- even though they fell behind on payments, even though the lender foreclosed. In this instance, a government agency bought the home and made the couple a lower-interest mortgage. They didn't have to pay the difference in what they owed and what the house was worth.\n\nI asked Christin how she felt about this.\n\nChristin: It was wonderful. It was nice to get the home back.\n\nStephanie Yao Long, Marketplace.
