"What are the requirements for an eye safety sign?\n\nANSI Z535 (and in some jurisdictions, OSHA) require that all warning signs placed on machines which have an eyewash station attached to them (or on a wall near the machine) include the eye safety sign on it. This is one of the most important eye safety signs for all machines.\n\nThese signs can be purchased in different materials and with different options to suit the needs of your application. Signs with an attached base can be screwed into place. Signs with a magnet can be attached to machines with magnetic surfaces. Signs with an adhesive backing can be placed on machines without screw or magnetized surfaces. Choose your eye safety sign below to see what options are available to you.
