"This is the work of idiots who do not know what they are doing. They have no idea about cars, engines or aerodynamics, and in the end they will pay for it," team principal Peter Sauber said in a statement.\n\nF1 racing, one of the world's most lucrative sports, has for years been plagued by small teams on tight budgets. The sport's commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone is trying to improve the situation and has created a fund, estimated to be worth up to $40 million, to support teams in dire straits.\n\n"The idea of taking money from one and giving it to the other is not very positive," Sauber said. "It creates the possibility of a new form of slavery. I do not think that anyone who worked in the factories during the war thought about whether a tank would end up being driven by a German or an Englishman. He was just happy to be making money. But people are not stupid, and there are some consequences that need to be considered. This is just crazy. It will never work."\n\nFerrari, BMW-Sauber, McLaren and Renault, four of the sport's top teams, have signed up to the initiative but Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo said Sauber was missing the point.\n\n"If the results of the championship are being hampered by an imbalanced distribution of resources, then there is a reason for the redistribution," he said.\n\nSauber's team have won 10 world championships but are among a number of outfits on the verge of going under as the sport's top teams spend millions of dollars in search of an elusive tenth title.
