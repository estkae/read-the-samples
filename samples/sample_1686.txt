The Artemis Fowl and Holly Short stories are like your favorite chocolate and peanut butter together. One story focuses on Holly, and the other is from Artemis’ point of view. This story takes place before Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident.\n\nThe story begins with Artemis getting angry at the police for allowing Fowl Manor to be used as a base for some raids, and he does not want to have anything to do with the Irish police. He is, however, desperate to get his hands on a certain piece of technology. When he goes to see the man who is trying to sell it, he finds that the deal is going poorly. Artemis comes up with a different solution, but it isn’t long before Holly Short and the rest of the police arrive. They get a lead that the man who’s selling the stolen technology will be in a certain bar that night, so they all go to stake it out. But something goes wrong when they go in and a mysterious man shows up, knocking Holly out. Artemis realizes he is not dealing with an ordinary gangster. Artemis wants to help Holly and will go to any lengths to do so. But he must also finish his deal with the seller in order to save his family from a horrible fate.\n\nLike all of Eoin Colfer’s books, it is an interesting read and a page turner. There is always something going on. It’s funny and dark in parts, but there are also many humorous moments. The story itself is intriguing, with some surprising plot twists and a thrilling ending. It is one of the best books I’ve read in a long time.\n\n5/5 stars
