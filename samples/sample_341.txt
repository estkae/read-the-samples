RIGS Creator Platform Playstation 4\n\nPC Genre Shooter, Sports Release Date 29th October 2016 Price $59.99 (PSVR Only) $19.99\n\nRIGS is an action sports game exclusively for PSVR. It was developed by Guerrilla Cambridge (and published by Sony) and released on October 29th, 2016. It takes place in a futuristic sci-fi setting, where you play as one of a number of different characters. Each character uses a different kind of battle suit, allowing them to take part in 3 different sports. Those sports are essentially the 3 main games. They are called RIGS, Megaton, and Gravity Wars. These games play as though they’re real sports. They play more or less how you’d expect them to. You score points by hitting goals, and your objective is to take the ball, and score it in the goal.\n\nThe first game is RIGS, which is essentially a shooting game. There are multiple game modes. Each mode is the same, except you’re playing different characters, and there’s a different goal for you to hit. RIGS is the most fun game in the package, simply because it’s a FPS, which is something you don’t get a lot of in VR games.\n\nMegaton is a sort of bumper-car football game. It’s the second most fun game in the package, just because it’s an interesting spin on something we all know. It is also a lot easier to master than RIGS.\n\nGravity Wars is a very interesting concept, and very hard to master. The game has no physics, and you have to control your direction by using the stick on the right. It’s very challenging, and once you get the hang of it, it can be fun.\n\nRIGS: Mechanized Combat League is a game that is good fun for those who have VR. There’s nothing else like it. It has an interesting concept, and it makes for an interesting single player experience. The multiplayer is there if you want it, but if you don’t, you can use bots, and they will be enough to let you master the game. It does have a lot of potential, and if Guerrilla Cambridge do a sequel, it will most likely be worth it.\n\nPros:\n\nGreat for VR\n\nVariety\n\nWell made\n\nGood concept\n\nCons:
