I bought this for my sister and brother in law because they are not able to eat spicy foods. They liked it a lot and said it was a good balance of flavors. I love garlic and would have like a little more in the dish. The shrimp was very tender. The green beans were excellent. It was a nice quick dinner.\n\n0 people found this helpful.
