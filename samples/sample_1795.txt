Housing manages more than 200 unused properties, most of them acquired in recent years.\n\nIt makes sense to invite the province to take on a social-housing role.\n\nBut what about a better idea: invite all municipalities to take ownership of these properties and manage them with an eye to developing them for nonmarket rentals.\n\nThat way, mayors and councillors can at least take credit for moving forward on a key social issue.\n\nThey can point to a series of successes, in other words.\n\nIn Vancouver, where Mayor Gregor Robertson has proclaimed that homelessness is an issue of "public safety" and that the city is doing everything it can to solve the problem, it could result in a genuine breakthrough.\n\nAs long as the mayor can't get his mind around the idea of the city owning and developing social housing, Vancouver will continue to lag behind many North American cities that have embraced social housing.\n\nBut that's a political reality that will not change as long as the Vision Vancouver party controls the mayor's office and council.\n\nFor the record, I'm not naive about the obstacles that exist in Vancouver and other B.C. municipalities.\n\nThe economics of redevelopment make it extremely difficult for cities to generate the capital necessary to finance social-housing projects.\n\nHousing authorities, meanwhile, face the same financial and political constraints as other government agencies.\n\nThe B.C. government has no money to help with the costs of new social housing, though its minister responsible for housing has pledged to meet with housing activists.\n\nPremier Christy Clark is totally disinterested in the plight of the homeless.\n\nAs a consequence, politicians don't even talk about the idea of taking control of B.C. Housing properties and developing them for nonmarket rentals.\n\nAll that makes a lot of sense, but that doesn't mean it isn't the best option available.\n\nThe province could always decide to sell the properties if it determines that it can't manage them for social purposes.\n\nThat would be one way to meet the immediate demands of homelessness.\n\nThe B.C. government could also get involved by making them available for nonmarket rentals to senior levels of government, as has occurred with a number of Canadian Forces bases.\n\nGiven the costs of maintaining B.C. Housing properties, it could be financially viable for the province to use them as an investment fund for nonmarket rentals.\n\nWith the federal government unwilling to provide money for new social housing, cities should at least be allowed to take advantage of the empty properties that the province is now sitting on.\n\nHere's a twist that might appeal to Robertson and Vancouver council.\n\nImagine if it's made clear to Robertson and Vision Vancouver councillors that their role is to approve developments that don't displace low-income residents.\n\nThat would certainly be an incentive to do something to ease homelessness.\n\nIf the province and the city take responsibility for the two million square feet of B.C. Housing property, that could be a major step forward for both housing and homelessness.\n\nAnd it could be done with minimal investment by both levels of government.\n\nI realize that's not going to happen, but it's an idea worth raising for discussion.
