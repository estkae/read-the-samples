"CHICAGO (AP) â€” An American Airlines pilot has been removed from flying duties after he temporarily parked a plane on a taxiway where four other airliners were waiting to take off at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.\n\nAn investigation into the Saturday incident is ongoing, airline spokesman Ross Feinstein said Sunday.\n\nFeinstein said the pilot has been taken off flying duty "pending the outcome of the investigation." He didn't specify how long the pilot would be grounded.\n\nNo other crew members were disciplined, and the incident won't affect the scheduling of the roughly 3,000 flights a day the airline operates around the world, Feinstein said.\n\nHe declined to release the name of the pilot or the number of years he had been flying for the airline.\n\nThe Chicago Department of Aviation said in a statement that the pilot of the American Airlines plane, which had arrived from Nashville, Tenn., was supposed to go to a designated taxiway but instead went to a parallel taxiway where four other airliners were waiting for clearance to take off.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear how close the plane came to taking off.\n\nAccording to radar information cited in the aviation department statement, the aircraft came within 100 feet of an aircraft on the ground and approximately 200 feet from another aircraft.\n\nThe aviation department is investigating the incident along with the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nAmerican Airlines has endured two crashes this year and five in 2015. Saturday's incident is unlikely to do much to allay the fears of passengers and the traveling public.\n\n"It's obviously one of those things that happen occasionally. It's a pretty serious mistake," said Henry Harteveldt, founder of the Atmosphere Research Group. "It's a reminder that airline pilots are human beings and that despite their extensive training, sometimes they make mistakes."\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Don Babwin contributed to this report.
