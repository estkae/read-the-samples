"How has music from Spain been perceived in its country of origin? After World War II, a new generation of composers, nurtured by the European avant-garde, began to write in a new, progressive, experimental vein. The growth of technology, which had already made its mark on the theatre, the visual arts, architecture and the cinema, had also started to make itself felt in the music world.\n\nSpanish composers, like their European colleagues, were attracted to the possibilities offered by the new electronic and experimental instruments, and soon took their place among the most important of the international avant-garde. This programme presents a series of fascinating compositions from this period of dynamic change, providing a fascinating insight into how this new generation of Spanish composers reacted to the environment in which they lived.
