This study aimed to examine whether self-reported job stress is associated with accelerated vascular calcification, independent of well-established risk factors and health behaviours. METHODS: Vascular calcification was assessed at the femoral neck (FN) and calcaneus by multi-slice computed tomography, as an indicator of coronary artery calcification and peripheral arterial disease, respectively...\n\nAugust 2016: Heart: Official Journal of the British Cardiac Society
