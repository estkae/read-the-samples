Good job, but a few odd things:\n\n1. I feel like the spin could be changed to make the sound a little more rich and ambient.\n\n2. For a piano, it's kinda weird how the keys themselves sound. I'm sure they could be improved to sound more like a piano.\n\n3. The hi-hat at the end sounds rather unnecessary, although it does give it a nice touch.\n\n4. I would recommend putting more interesting percussion, even if it's just for variety.\n\nOtherwise, it's an interesting take on a pretty well known piece. Keep it up!
