"It's a joke. It's absolutely a joke. It's ridiculous."\n\nAllan (A.J.) MacEachern is talking about the legal dispute between the Saskatchewan Roughriders and veteran slotback Geroy Simon, who has remained on the sidelines during training camp.\n\nIt's the same dispute that has consumed much of the Regina sports media for the past few days, a simmering conflict that has seen accusations of both workplace harassment and age discrimination lobbed at the CFL team.\n\nWhile neither the Roughriders nor Simon would speak publicly Wednesday, it is believed that Simon, who was in a contract year, asked the Roughriders to pay for a personal trainer this season.\n\nThe Riders say no.\n\nSimon says no.\n\nMacEachern says yes.\n\nMacEachern is Simon's agent. He has been for more than a decade, and the two men have become extremely close over that time. When Simon wasn't playing in B.C. during the last two seasons, he spent the off-season in Calgary with MacEachern's family.\n\nThe relationship is so strong that it led to MacEachern's son, Conor, deciding to take a hiatus from his job as a graduate student at Princeton University in order to work with Simon over the past couple of months.\n\nSimon has been one of the CFL's elite receivers for more than a decade.\n\nHe signed a four-year deal with the Roughriders in 2013, but that was before MacEachern started working for the CFL Players' Association. He's now its director of football operations.\n\nAnd he has seen many examples of players being forced to pay for their own services — including trainers.\n\n"I think it's common," he said. "I think it's standard practice.\n\n"We have to remember — there's no minimum wage in the CFL. There's no union, either. So what they're doing is perfectly within their rights. And it's not because he's 35. It's just the league in general."\n\nMacEachern, who said he speaks to Simon every day, said he couldn't comment on the harassment and age discrimination accusations.\n\n"That's going to be something that's played out over the course of the year, and if that becomes the story and the narrative of the year, that's going to be a pretty tough one to deal with," he said.\n\nThe dispute, though, has drawn plenty of attention, especially after Roughriders head coach Corey Chamblin told reporters on Tuesday that Simon had missed meetings and was no longer a member of the team.\n\nAsked if he was still a member of the Roughriders, Chamblin said: "Not at this moment."\n\nChamblin and general manager Brendan Taman held a news conference Wednesday to try to explain the situation.\n\nTaman said Simon missed three meetings, one of which was on the eve of training camp. He also said the Riders sent Simon's trainer packing.\n\n"As I sit here today, he is no longer with our organization," Taman said. "That was a decision made."\n\nTaman also said that if Simon wasn't in the best shape he could be, then he wouldn't be in the lineup.\n\n"And I don't think he's in the best shape he can be," Taman said. "If he's not, then he won't play."\n\nChamblin added that it would be a "joke" for the Riders to pay for Simon's trainer.\n\nMacEachern, though, said that the Roughriders haven't said anything about Simon's weight.\n\n"They've never mentioned it," he said. "Not once."\n\nThe Riders' stance might be different if Simon was under contract. The team doesn't have to pay him if it doesn't want to.\n\n"When you sign a contract, the way the league works, it's their decision on if they want to release you or not," MacEachern said. "And if they choose to, they pay the rest of the contract. But the first year, they don't have to pay it. They've done that with other players in the past, they're doing it with other players right now."\n\nWhat's also interesting about the situation is the fact that Simon is fighting this while a prominent group of players has fought to change the CFL's rules.\n\nThe CFL Players' Association has long lobbied for a cap on salaries, which would allow teams to hold on to more of their money. Currently, teams are allowed to spend to the cap, but a player can ask to be released if he believes he's being underpaid.\n\nA recent study by the CFLPA found that 70 per cent of the league's players were being paid less than $50,000 a season.\n\n"I don't know the player's situation and whether or not that's a contract that he can get out of or not, and I'm not going to talk about any of the facts or circumstances about what happened," MacEachern said.\n\nHe did say, though, that Simon's contract is one of the main reasons for the current rule.\n\n"That's why they created the rule, because they knew that there were going to be situations like this."\n\nmmccormick@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/murraylp
