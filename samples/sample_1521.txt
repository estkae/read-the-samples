A homicide investigation was underway Monday after an 11-month-old boy was found dead in his car seat in the back of a car parked in front of a strip mall, the Los Angeles Police Department said.\n\nThe boy was discovered in the car, which was parked near the entrance of the Michael's craft store in the 5900 block of South Sepulveda Boulevard in the Hyde Park neighborhood, at about 3:30 p.m. Sunday. He had been in the car for "an extended amount of time," police said.\n\nLAPD Capt. Peter Whittingham told The Times that the car was not locked, but there were indications that the car seat was in use when the baby was found.\n\nThe car was parked in front of a South Bay Discount Mall, which is across the street from the medical offices of Michael Jackson's physician, Dr. Conrad Murray.\n\nIt was unclear how long the baby had been dead.\n\nThe LAPD would not confirm the boy's age, the nature of his injuries, the identity of his parents or their relationship to him.\n\n"It's a tragic case," said LAPD Lt. Andy Neiman, adding that police were awaiting the coroner's report to determine the cause of death.\n\nWhittingham said police did not believe there was any public danger, but a search of the vehicle and surrounding areas was underway.\n\n"We're looking at all possibilities right now," he said.\n\nWhittingham added that police are investigating whether the baby was left in the car accidentally or intentionally.\n\nHe said it appeared the baby was left in the car for an extended period of time. "It's a sad, sad situation," he said.\n\nALSO:\n\nLAPD in mourning after 3 officers killed in 2 months\n\nDonald"
