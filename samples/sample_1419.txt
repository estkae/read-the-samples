"The Thelesparian Cabal was an organization founded in the Thelesparian Sea by Akusar, the Archmage of Water. His objective was to manipulate the course of history in favor of Thelesparians. The group had an iron-clad rule about their personal lives: they were not permitted to marry or have children. Instead, they were required to take other members into their fold in order to expand their power base. The cabal was destroyed when Zz'dtri stole their immortality spell and sacrificed himself to destroy it.\n\nContents show]\n\nBeliefs Edit\n\nThe cabal was founded on a series of tenants that could be described as fairly strict, especially by comparison to other religions and organizations in Abeir-Toril. In order to be a member, the member was not permitted to marry or have children. This was done in order to keep the organization strong, since the members would be passing their powers and knowledge onto new members, rather than starting families and having new generations of mages to rival them. Members of the cabal were expected to remain within their ranks, and not to interact with members of other cabals unless absolutely necessary.\n\nOrganization Edit\n\nMembers Edit\n\nThe cabal was composed of both humans and elves. It was led by the Archmage of Water. A position that changed regularly, with a member who had demonstrated leadership qualities.\n\nThe members of the cabal used to meet in the Keep of Thirteen (a structure that rose up out of the sea), and discuss matters important to the Cabal. Since Zz'dtri betrayed the group and stole their immortality spell, the members now are dispersed, and not as organized as they once were.\n\nImportant Events Edit\n\nThe Cabal played a large role in the destruction of the kingdom of Auzkovyn, after which they formed a council to rule over the ruins, they set the place up as a puppet state for them to use as they see fit. It is not clear if they know that the kingdom is now ruled by a Vistani Fyndi through the Mask of Winters.\n\nThe members of the Cabal made themselves known to the world when they came together to defeat Zz'dtri and claim his prize, the Undying Magick.\n\nThey then planned on using this powerful magic to summon Water Dragons to do their bidding.\n\nAfter the Archmage and the Duke of Riva stopped the process, the Cabal members took some time to regroup.\n\nKnown Members Edit\n\nThis list is incomplete.\n\nAbram (member) (founder)\n\nAkusar (member) (founder)\n\nEklusus (member)\n\nThe Duke of Riva (member)\n\nThe Archmage (member)\n\nThe "Pirate King"\n\nUnnamed Female Elven Wizard (member)\n\nZz'dtri (former member)\n\nNotable artifacts Edit\n\nFang of Doom, a massive dagger given to The Duke of Riva as a symbol of his membership in the cabal\n\nImmortality Spell, stolen by Zz'dtri and later destroyed\n\nSkull of Vecna, used by The Duke of Riva as a focus for the Undying Magick\n\nThe Whelm of Olios, a magical helm that grants it's wearer greater powers of persuasion.\n\nKeep of Thirteen, an arcane laboratory, and the seat of the cabal.\n\nReferences Edit\n\nSources Edit\n\nOfficial Campaign\n\nUnofficial Campaigns
