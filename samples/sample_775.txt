"Prof. Petitpas Taylor: Legalization Could Have Been Handled More “Artfully”\n\nLegalization of cannabis could have been handled more “artfully”, says a member of the federal government’s cannabis task force who is now Canada’s Minister of Health.\n\nIn an interview with the public broadcaster CBC, Ginette Petitpas Taylor said that the marijuana legalization bill as written could have been better.\n\nPetitpas Taylor said that the cannabis task force was not given the time to study legalization to its fullest extent, although it had sufficient time to make an impact on public health and safety. She added that the task force did not get sufficient time to consult with the provinces, although it tried to do so.\n\nSpeaking about the changes that were made to the original bill, she said, “It could have been done more artfully and more in-depth.”\n\nShe explained that legalization “has been going on for a while in many provinces” and the Canadian public was already aware of cannabis. She added that it was known that the Government was moving toward legalizing cannabis. “So, we should have had more time to consult with Canadians and the provinces on these issues.”\n\nSpeaking about the implementation of the legislation, Petitpas Taylor said, “We were moving on an aggressive time frame and there were certain things we were unable to address to the extent we would have wanted.”\n\nPetitpas Taylor said that one of the things she would have liked to see in the legislation is the ability to make rules around edible marijuana, something that will come in July 2019.\n\nShe also said that it would have been good to have had rules that “regulate advertising and marketing” so that it was appropriate. “You want to make sure that it’s not promoting the use of this to children.”\n\nShe added that as a parent of two teenagers, she was keen on seeing this as a parent.\n\n“As a parent, I want to make sure that we have the regulations in place, to make sure we are protecting children,” she said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Quebec government has decided to raise the legal age for cannabis use to 21 from 18. The province also said it will not allow the use of marijuana in the presence of children. The province said it would allow its citizens to smoke marijuana only in private homes.\n\nIn its law on marijuana, Quebec will only allow cannabis to be grown in a residence and will not permit its purchase in stores.\n\n(Featured image by Guschenkova/Shutterstock.com)
