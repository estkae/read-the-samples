"Vitamin K is a group of structurally similar compounds which are known as menaquinones. Menaquinones are organic quinones (carbon molecules with two or more covalently bound quinoline rings) and vitamin K. Menaquinones were originally used as dyes.\n\n\n\nIn mammals, vitamin K occurs as a single chemical entity, known as phylloquinone or phylloquinone. Phylloquinone is an alcohol that is readily oxidized and is inactive as a vitamin. It must be reduced in the body to form active menaquinones, including MK-4 and MK-7.\n\n\n\nNattoPharma's unique product lines are produced under an exclusive contract manufacturing agreement with CheilJedang, a Korean company. The company is a leader in the nutraceutical industry.\n\n\n\nNattoPharma's process begins with raw material testing in the laboratory. Our partners at CheilJedang cultivate the highest quality of natto in Korea, according to their standards of excellence, which conform to the guidelines of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These standards of excellence meet or exceed Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).\n\n\n\nCheilJedang uses FDA approved technology to extract phylloquinone from natto, which is then purified and converted to MK-4 and MK-7. The manufacturing facility meets the highest quality and food safety standards.\n\n\n\nMK-7 is available in the forms of anhydrous powder and microcrystalline capsules. All of NattoPharma's products meet the strict standards of GMP.
