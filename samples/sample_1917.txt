The management of Papua New Guinea's biggest hospital is warning the next phase of its rehabilitation will take longer than expected.\n\nAustralia is paying the bulk of the bill, but the hospital's management says it has run into some unexpected difficulties with its reconstruction work.\n\nChief Executive, Phillip Robinson, says an area that was supposed to have been upgraded is actually in worse shape than they thought.\n\n"Our problem is with the walls, and the foundation, and the superstructure.\n\n"What we've found is that when the walls of the old hospital were taken down, they've actually exposed old timbers.\n\n"They're so wet that it's almost impossible to get any type of new material into the old structure."\n\nMr Robinson says it has also become clear that the builders are not as familiar with the way Papua New Guinea hospitals are constructed as the team expected.
