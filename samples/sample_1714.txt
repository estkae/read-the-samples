For instance, if you buy a chicken sausage product, you should see an appropriate percentage of chicken.\n\nThe meat content in the sausage should be identified clearly on the label, so it is easy for the consumer to identify the ingredients and know exactly what is inside the product.\n\nAre you eating what you think you are eating?\n\nThere are a wide range of cooked sausages on the market and with a little detective work, the sausage meat content can be clearly identified on the pack.\n\nThis is how you can identify the sausage meat content, just have a look at the label:\n\nDoes the label indicate what the meat content is by percentages? If so, this is the best way to find out exactly what is in your sausage product. It's so simple - the lower the percentage of meat, the more processed the sausage. If the sausage is sold as fresh or raw, the label must indicate the actual weight of the meat content (pork, chicken, etc.)\n\nA percentage of pork, chicken or other meat must be labelled on the sausage. It should also have the ingredients listed in descending order. This will give you a good idea of what the product is made up of.\n\nFor instance, if the meat content is specified at 70%, this is a good indication that the product is made up of pork meat. However, you should check the label to confirm this, because there may be small amounts of added water, fat or salt, which can have an impact on the final product.\n\nIf the sausage product is labelled as 'meat product', this is a good indication that it has been cooked in water.\n\nIf it says 'meat product, so must not contain more than 12% moisture. So if you see that this is the case, you can be certain that the product is cooked in water.\n\nIf the sausage product is labelled as 'pre-cooked', this is not a guarantee that the product has been cooked in water.\n\nIt is just a statement to indicate that the meat has been treated in a way that could be described as being pre-cooked, so this is no guarantee that the meat has been cooked.\n\nEven if it has been cooked, it may still be difficult to identify the meat content because of the added water and fat.\n\nIt is therefore important to look for the meat content to ensure that it is sufficient for the product to be labelled as a cooked product.\n\nIf the sausage product is labelled as 'minced meat', 'minced' or 'minced pork', it is safe to assume that the product has been cooked in water.\n\nFor more information and guidance on food labelling, visit www.food.gov.uk/your-consumer-rights.
