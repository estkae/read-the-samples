The board was an item he got from a neighbor that he could not give away, he said, and the bird was the same model that flew in the 1970s.\n\n“So I came up with the idea, let’s put the bird on the board,” he said.\n\nThe sign went up three days ago, and Lalli said he was impressed by the attention it was getting.\n\n“Everybody knows this,” he said of the bird. “It’s a part of our lives.”\n\nHe was unsure of the future of the sign. He said he didn’t expect it to be there forever.\n\n“At some point, it will be put away,” he said.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, people were stopping in front of his store to take pictures and get autographs.\n\n“Everybody that comes in here, they have stories about their bird,” Lalli said. “And they all have a part of their bird with them.”\n\nLalli said the board would be up until the week of March 19, when he was expected to move his store to a new location on Main Street.\n\nThe old building is being renovated, and once he is settled in the new place, the bird sign will likely go up in front of that shop, Lalli said.\n\njhoran@durhamadvocate.com
