"Monday, March 14, 2019\n\nThe United States and New Zealand signed the Christchurch Call, a pledge to make the Internet a safer place. The agreement, launched by French President Emmanuel Macron, was initially signed by the U.S., U.K., Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Senegal, Indonesia, Singapore, and Spain. France, Brazil, Italy, Japan, and the European Union have since joined. The Christchurch Call’s stated purpose is “to protect citizens online and promote the development of technology to better protect users.”\n\nOne proposal contained in the pledge is for companies to provide “private right of action for online intermediaries to protect users.” The companies would be required to “develop and implement policies and measures to foster respect for online safety and digital security of users,” and make these policies publicly available. Additionally, companies would be required to implement “cooperative mechanisms” for sharing “appropriate and lawful user data.”\n\nThe Christchurch Call’s language around private action and data sharing is not new. It does not depart from existing obligations to share data and requires companies to take reasonable measures to combat the threat of terrorist content. Nonetheless, the pledge suggests that public enforcement of laws on private platforms is not enough and that further enforcement tools are needed.\n\nArticle Topics\n\naccess
