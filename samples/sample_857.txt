Spherical Dice, labeled as 12-Sided Dice, are an uncommon variety of die that appears in Mario Party 4, Mario Party 5, Mario Party 6, Mario Party 7, Mario Party 8, Mario Party 9, and Mario Party: Island Tour. They function the same as regular Dice Blocks in that they roll and land on a number value, and allow players to move a number of spaces on the board based on that value. The color of the sphere varies from game to game; from green in Mario Party 4 to red in Mario Party 5.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nMario Party 4 [ edit ]\n\nMario Party 4.
