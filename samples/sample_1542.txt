Say what you will about Dove: this moisturizing body wash doesn't irritate the skin, and it has an incredibly light fragrance. There are far more expensive body washes on the market that are equally impressive. It does not contain any harsh ingredients, so it is not at all drying to the skin.\n\nA review by amazon reviewer\n\nI use this product religiously and it works for me. It is gentle enough that I can use it every day and it doesn't dry out my skin. I have never had any allergic reaction to it. It lathers well, and feels very smooth on my skin. I am happy to have found a non-drying soap that is cruelty-free, and from a company that practices ethical marketing. Dove makes a decent quality product, and I will definitely buy it again.\n\nA review by amazon reviewer
