As global oil prices continue to rise, some observers are warning that rising gas prices may cause a major economic downturn in 2008. What's more, the recent natural gas pipeline explosion in California, which prompted a moratorium on new development, will exacerbate the problem.\n\nOver the next five years, the United States will have to import nearly half of the energy it uses, according to the most recent forecast by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. As of now, the United States is the largest energy importer in the world, importing more energy than any other country. We import 3.5 million barrels of oil per day, and more than 80 percent of our oil comes from foreign countries. This puts us at the mercy of OPEC nations, and increasingly Russia, who we are now trying to court to invest in our own energy infrastructure.\n\nThis dependence is a matter of great concern for many energy analysts. Some say that it's time to cut our losses and invest in the most energy-efficient technology possible while we still can.\n\nOur continued dependence on foreign oil could have a long-term impact on the economy, they say, because the price of oil will continue to rise with the demand, and the price of energy could skyrocket in the next decade.\n\n'We Need to Start Thinking Now'\n\n"Energy is not just a topic that's come up in the last few months," says Matthew Ranson, an analyst with the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. "It's been discussed in a serious way for decades now."\n\nAccording to Ranson, for a long time, people weren't really paying attention to energy issues in this country. But then, he says, "the economy collapsed in the last year or so and the [energy] debate started up again in full force."\n\nBut even now, he says, "we need to start thinking about it now. We can't just wait."\n\nThe economy will be hurt most by high energy prices, says Ranson. "Energy, unlike other goods and services, is necessary for people to have jobs and make a living and grow the economy," he says.\n\nThe crisis is already in the works. "Gas prices are expected to increase at the rate of $3 a year," Ranson says. "At some point, it's going to make people reconsider car ownership, which we are seeing already."\n\nOther analysts have noted that the worst economic effects will come in the next few years as oil prices begin to hit consumers' wallets.\n\n"It's really important for people to understand that we don't have to sit around and wait for it to hit us," Ranson says. "We can do things now to change the way we make energy choices."\n\nThe United States needs to cut back on our reliance on oil, he says, and start developing clean, domestic energy resources like solar and wind power.\n\n"We need to think differently about the choices that we're making," he says. "If we have a choice to import oil from places that don't like us, or if we have a choice to invest in clean domestic energy that's good for us, we need to make the choice."\n\nThe Golden Years\n\nRanson admits that it's not going to be easy to move toward a clean energy economy. But there are things that can be done, such as improving efficiency and investing in new energy technologies. "We can't do everything at once," he says.\n\nTo help reduce energy demand, Congress has passed a law to require the federal government to improve energy efficiency in its buildings.\n\nThere are also efforts under way to address the energy crisis in cities, where people can be more dependent on energy, according to Ranson.\n\n"A lot of cities are thinking about this in different ways," he says. "In New York, they're talking about ways to reduce car ownership, like getting people out of cars and into public transportation, making public transportation more convenient, and adding bike paths. You can start with that and see what happens."\n\nThe Natural Gas Supply\n\nAnother important energy issue to keep an eye on is the country's natural gas supply. Natural gas accounts for nearly 20 percent of the country's energy, and nearly 60 percent of the nation's electricity generation.\n\n"We don't really have a clear understanding of how the supply of natural gas will be affected by what's going on in California," says Fred Millar, senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank, Energy Security Initiative.\n\nMillar believes that the California situation may signal "troubles ahead" for the country's natural gas supply. "There are real questions about how much natural gas is going to be produced by the industry in the coming years," he says.\n\nThere's been a dramatic drop in natural gas prices in the last few years, and that has encouraged a lot of companies to start new drilling operations, says Millar. But natural gas prices were going up last week, Millar says, and "the question now is, has the bubble burst?"\n\nA recent explosion at a Southern California natural gas pipeline, which took the lives of two workers, has put a halt to natural gas production in the state. The pipeline was owned by the Texas-based company Sempra Energy, and the blast occurred near Bakersfield. It is still unclear what caused the explosion.\n\nThe blast caused a temporary halt to the development of the Puente Valley Pipeline, a major new pipeline project.\n\nMillar says that the halt on the pipeline will have a major effect on the state's energy supplies. "It could cause a major problem for California's electricity supplies," he says.\n\nMillar adds that the price of natural gas is likely to rise in the coming weeks and months because of the halt.\n\nOil and the Economy\n\nHigh energy prices are also a major concern for economists. "The most immediate effect of a large price increase is inflation," says David Hughes, a geologist who has written extensively on energy issues. "We can expect energy prices to increase for gasoline, electricity, natural gas, and other fossil fuels."\n\nBut economists are still debating how the economy will be affected. Some economists say that higher energy prices could have a positive impact on the economy, while others say the impact could be negative.\n\n"It's too early to tell," says Millar. "We're still in the stage where the price increases are in the process of playing out."\n\n"The economy is more fragile than it was in the 1970s, and energy is more integrated into the economy, and prices are higher," says Ranson.\n\nBut he believes that the economy is better positioned to deal with energy prices now than it was in the 1970s. "I don't think the impact of high energy prices will be nearly as bad this time," he says.\n\nA slowdown in the economy and a possible recession, Ranson says, could cause energy prices to spike even more.\n\nBut even if the economy takes a downturn, Ranson says that energy prices will keep going up. "People may stop spending on some things," he says, "but energy prices are going to keep going up."\n\nRanson says that people will have to make choices about how they live, and the government will have to decide how much of a subsidy it's willing to provide for the alternative energy industry.\n\nHughes believes that, ultimately, high energy prices will bring about some kind of economic crisis. "In my view, this is a symptom of a much bigger problem, which is our oil-based economy," he says. "We can no longer afford the fossil fuel based economy we have had for the past century."\n\nCopyright 2007 E&E Publishing. All Rights Reserved.
