This light has so many different settings it was nice because I can use it for camping and for my son who is a boy scout I can use it as a headlamp as well. I loved the fact it has a blinking mode so you can see it at night on your vehicle. You can put it on a timer and have it come on and go off at certain times and the light stays the same level it doesn't go dim so you know it's still going to work. I just love the different settings. And this is a brand that I trust and can always go to. It has never let me down and it always works. I always love buying these products.\n\n#RankBoosterReview #Sponsored #ArcticFireProducts #ArcticFire\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Arctic-Fire-2-in-1-flashlight-waterproof/dp/B0785CZBVL
