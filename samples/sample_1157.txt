"As always, I've been gathering and compiling a list of favorite quotes. I've always loved sharing quotes with friends and family. I thought I would start sharing some of my favorite quotes on my blog. This quote is from Scott DeGarmo's Blog . It's a favorite because it resonates with me. Enjoy!\n\nThe longer I live the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude to me is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than failures, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness, or skill. It will make or break a company… a church… a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice every day regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past… we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude. I am convinced that whatever I plant in my mind will one day become my reality.\n\nWhen people spend their days in an environment where attitudes are positive, and have opportunities to interact with other people who are motivated and produce positive outcomes, they become energized. You may say, “I do not choose to be positive.” But it is your choice to be positive or negative, no one else. You have a choice. You have a choice to be happy or sad. You have a choice to be motivated or to complain. You have a choice to succeed or to fail. You have a choice to be positive or negative. You are in control of your own attitude. The first thing to remember is that it is your choice, you are in control.
