It's one thing to be considered the best in the league in the NFL, but to have that prestige considered the best of all-time is a different beast.\n\nThat's the spot NFL Network analyst and Hall of Fame running back Marshall Faulk found himself in on Thursday.\n\nAccording to NFL.com, Faulk has been named the Greatest Show on Turf's all-time team after the Rams -- who boasted Faulk and other stars -- put together one of the best offenses in the history of the league.\n\nThe honor came at the expense of former Rams quarterback Kurt Warner, who is now a studio analyst for the network. Faulk was taken over Warner as a rusher and receiver by almost 500 yards, but also tallied almost 400 more points.\n\nSo while Warner may not have necessarily be considered better than Faulk, he certainly belongs in the discussion as one of the greatest players of his time.\n\nFaulk did lead the league in rushing touchdowns in 2000 with 24, which helped him win the rushing crown that year. But Warner also did that in 1999, and only was held off the top of the rushing charts by Faulk by six yards.\n\nFaulk and Warner have a solid history with each other and they were part of the greatest offense in NFL history when the Rams won Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000.\n\nSo while Faulk may not have been the greatest quarterback in history, he certainly deserves his place as one of the greatest players. And the greatest player of the Greatest Show on Turf has been decided.
