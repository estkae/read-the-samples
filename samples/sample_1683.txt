"Elisa was amazing!!! First, we booked the room the night before, since we got there on a weekend and everything else was full. She replied in less than 5 minutes, saying she would cancel the reservation she had in that time for us. Once there, we were surprised to be on the second floor. It was great, and the room was just what we needed. Very clean, everything looked great, the bed was extremely comfortable, and Elisa was awesome. She was very kind and we felt at home, the same as if we were at my place! We had the freedom to come and go as we wanted, which is the way it should be when you are renting out your place. We even got the chance to have a very nice conversation with her! The location was perfect, right across from Central Park, and a lot of places we wanted to go were only a few blocks away! Totally recommend staying here.
