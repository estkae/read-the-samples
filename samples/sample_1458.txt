Prior to joining Interboro in 2011, he worked with Michael Manfredi and The Architect’s Newspaper, designing two national competitions: The Downtown Project in Las Vegas, Nevada; and the Memphis Meets Me competition. He has a Masters in Architecture from Harvard University Graduate School of Design, and received his Bachelor of Architecture from the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City, Mexico. In 2009 he won the Domus Latinoamericana Award, and the Pratt Institute Meyer Travel Grant.\n\nSitting inside a former historic home at 14th and T, Raúl was joined by his friend and colleague Ildar Gilyazutdinov.\n\nCan you talk about the development of the Rosy-Homes?\n\nA couple of years ago, I was on a plane heading from New York to Venice to visit my girlfriend. On the plane was this guy, a Russian architect, and he was talking to me about the development of the Russian program, and I was like, “what the fuck?” because he kept talking about this architectural program, but then I was like, “OK, I guess that’s it”. Then we get off the plane and it turns out we are going to the same place. The guy picks me up and he starts talking about this architectural program called “The Rosy-Homes”, and how we were going to build this thing that would be like this fake house, and how this guy from Harvard, who is a good friend of his, was going to do this project. It was for him. He was a crazy man. He’s one of the most famous Russian architects, and he would pick these people, put them together in a house and live with them for two months, working on this project. We were going to be the first group in this house.\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nWe didn’t know what was going on, but we’re going to Venice for three days, and this guy, this architect, lived in Italy for a while and he still has a house there. He’s like, “let’s go!”. We were like, “OK!”.\n\nThe Rosy-Homes were in the development of an abandoned building that had been left for decades. They were trying to renovate it, and they had three architects in the house at the time.\n\nThen one day, this guy came in the house and he was like, “my god, it’s been two months”. It was the last two months of the year and he had to go to Russia. We had this big Christmas party and he was like, “I can’t go back.” He came to the US in ‘72, and he hasn’t seen his country in like 40 years. He says, “I can’t go back, but I want to go.” So we’re like, “let’s go!”. So he just goes and he invites us to come to Russia. I got my friends to come, and we go to Russia for three months. It’s crazy.\n\nIt was like the Wild West in Russia.\n\nIt was like the Wild West. There’s no real laws in place.\n\nIt was also my first experience of actually being in the USSR in 1990s.\n\nWe go back to Moscow, and he says, “you guys should stay. I’m going to be working here, you guys should stay.”\n\nI have a friend from Harvard, Eduardo de la Riva, and he’s from Colombia, and he came to see me in Mexico. So we’re all like, “fuck, let’s go!”. We started this project, and I have no idea how it happened, but I have no idea how it happened. We were working with a collective of architects from Moscow, like six people.\n\nWe started this project, and the Russian guy’s telling me how to do this project, and I’m like, “dude, I don’t know. I’m sorry.” He’s like, “don’t worry, I’m going to take care of it”. We start working on this project, and he says, “it’s going to be the Rosy-Homes”. Then he starts talking to the curator at the Garage Museum, and we’re just working on the project and then suddenly it’s like, “okay, you’re invited to do this exhibition at the Garage Museum.” And I’m like, “no way.” And he’s like, “don’t worry. I’m going to take care of it.”\n\nWe started working with another friend of ours, who is a photographer, and he’s like, “fuck, let’s do this.” And he starts taking pictures.\n\nAt the same time, I’m living with another guy from Harvard, Paul Lyons. He was doing a project with another guy, and they wanted to do something in Moscow.\n\nHow did the three of you get in contact?\n\nI have no idea. We didn’t know each other, but it was like, “you’re the architect, you’re the artist, you’re the photographer.” “No, I’m not, you are.” “No, you are.” “Let’s just go!” “Let’s go!”.\n\nAt the same time, Paul’s also working with another"
