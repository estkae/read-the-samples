Description\n\nDesigned by Catherine Kerr, The House of the Nightwalker began as an endeavor to get some of the most obscure texts in the history of the English language into the public domain. At present, Catherine Kerr has released a collection of texts and fragments written by the infamous Charles d’Hocquincourt (died 1463). D’Hocquincourt was a great collector of magical texts and owned some of the most significant collections in the history of Western occultism. D’Hocquincourt’s House of the Nightwalker is a collection of magical texts and fragments written and collected by d’Hocquincourt during his lifetime.\n\nThe House of the Nightwalker comprises two parts. The first part is a facsimile of d’Hocquincourt’s Book of the Nightwalker, a collection of rituals and alchemical processes attributed to Edward Kelley, a 16th century alchemist and spiritualist. In this volume, d’Hocquincourt includes the texts translated from a variety of sources in Latin, English, Italian, German and French.\n\nThe second part is an English translation of d’Hocquincourt’s Notebooks, which comprise works written in his own hand and works copied from the works of others, all of which he found interesting and valuable. This section includes a wide variety of subjects and is composed of alchemical and astrological texts, rituals, and fragments on the ars notoria, and other topics, including talismans, conjurations, spirits, incubi, and sabbats.\n\nThis work is important as a source for the study of alchemy, ceremonial magic, and the early history of the European Hermetic tradition.\n\nThis book is featured in our selection of 101 Books that Shaped Magick.
