The Wanderer a Black Rose and Blight (Black Rose Trilogy)\n\nSet amidst a backdrop of warring families and malevolent plots, The Wanderer follows the destinies of two families, the Holts and the Gardiners. As children, the Gardiners appear to be the lucky ones, but in fact, they are destined for destruction. On the other hand, it is the Holts, a scion of a great house, who end up making a world in which the Gardiners can flourish. Written in a spare, elegant prose, The Wanderer reveals a world in which men have "a choice of evils" but women have none.
