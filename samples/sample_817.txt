12/2/2013\n\nNEWTON, IOWA – Working for a living. Does it seem like something is missing from our everyday lives? Most of us, most of the time, do not have to think about working.\n\nWe get up, and go to work. There’s always enough time to eat, sleep, go to a ball game or watch a TV show.\n\nThere’s always enough time for that stuff.\n\nWe’ve got no problem with working. In fact, we like it. Most of us do.\n\nThat’s not the issue.\n\nThe issue is the fact that most of us like to earn our keep.\n\nWe like to think we are not being a burden to our society. We like to think we are not living in a free-lunch society.\n\nWe do have a real problem with people who can’t or won’t work.\n\nIn fact, the working public has a real problem with them.\n\nA growing number of those people have some sort of physical or mental disability that makes it impossible for them to work. They have no choice but to rely on the charity of others to survive.\n\nThis is not easy for those who work.\n\nThey have a goodly number of people who just won’t work at all, or will work just long enough to get the public to take care of them. It’s very difficult for those who work to keep their work ethic intact.\n\nIt’s also difficult for those who are disabled to keep their moral fiber intact.\n\nAnd that’s a good thing.\n\nThe hard workers in this society need to be reminded that they are providing a valuable service to society. They need to be reminded that without them society would crumble.\n\nWe also need to keep a place for those who cannot work. That can be difficult because many of those people have learned to rely on their fellow man for a handout.\n\nIt’s up to those who work to keep things in balance.\n\nThat’s not easy.\n\nThe people who work need to keep their perspective.\n\nAnd they need to keep their noses to the grindstone.\n\nThey need to put up with the people who do not want to work and remember that the whole society is better for their labors.
