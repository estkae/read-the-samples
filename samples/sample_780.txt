Temporary measures to help cool the overheating housing market have been extended, the Government has confirmed.\n\nPhoto: RNZ / Alexander Robertson\n\nThe extension of the measures will be for two years.\n\nThe Auckland housing market has risen sharply in recent months, and there is now a widely-held view the Auckland market is in a bubble.\n\nThe measures mean that:\n\nThe bright line test, which applies a tax on capital gains made on residential property, will apply in some circumstances, but not until 2018\n\nThe Government's land tax will be extended to unoccupied residential property, which is also due to come into effect in 2018.\n\n"We believe these are sensible, targeted and temporary measures, with a view to increasing housing supply and lifting the proportion of first home buyers in Auckland. It also means Government collects a little less revenue." Finance Minister Bill English said.\n\nRNZ Business Editor Rob Hosking said the measure has been extended, but the new land tax will not come into effect until 2018.\n\n"Land tax will only apply to 'under-occupied' homes, defined as any house or apartment that's unoccupied for more than six months of the year, in which case the owner will have to pay tax on it as though they were renting it out," he said.\n\n"At the moment there are approximately 41,000 vacant houses in Auckland - and that's without counting holiday homes, which would push that number higher."\n\nBanks and real estate companies are predicting prices will continue to rise.\n\n"The Auckland housing market has been in a state of severe imbalance for some time now, with demand outstripping supply, which is pushing house prices higher and making it difficult for first-home buyers to enter the market," said Peter Thompson, head of New Zealand for ANZ.\n\n"The [bright line] tax has been a step in the right direction, and should help to moderate house price inflation over time.\n\n"But the tax is unlikely to have a significant impact on the market over the next 12 months. More needs to be done."\n\nMike Alexander of real estate agency Barfoot and Thompson said the measures had helped reduce speculation.\n\n"The Government's recent housing market measures have had a positive impact on the Auckland housing market," he said.\n\n"As an example, prior to the first round of measures, the average sale price in Auckland was increasing at around 15 percent per annum. Since the introduction of the measures, prices have moderated to around 3 percent.\n\n"The Government has been very clear that they are looking to deliver a long-term solution to housing affordability, and we are looking forward to engaging with them on what we can do to support this over the coming months."\n\nFinance Minister Bill English said the measures would not prevent further gains in the housing market.\n\n"I can't say there's no risk of a bubble forming, but they're good, targeted, temporary measures, with a view to lifting the proportion of first home buyers in Auckland," he said.\n\nThe measures were due to expire in October, but were extended after consultations with the Reserve Bank and the Treasury.
