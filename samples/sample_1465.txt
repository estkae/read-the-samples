Just a few things I wanted to make sure to mention.\n\nA. If you are signing up for the newsletter at the bottom of the page, you have to scroll all the way down to the bottom, not just to the end of the posts. If you don’t see a newsletter sign up, you probably don’t have a Facebook account.\n\nB. If you are going to follow me on Twitter, I’m @mowens88 and you can follow the blog @openmyeyespreach. I am not the greatest at social media, but I think it will get better as I learn it.\n\nC. I don’t talk about it, but this blog is not as active as I would like. I still enjoy doing it, and I don’t think I will stop blogging anytime soon. I just hope you find the content valuable. If you have any suggestions or if you would like to see me write more, please let me know.\n\nD. Here is the new media page.
