"The moments after disaster strikes are harrowing and leave thousands stranded in a shelter with basic needs unattended.\n\nAfter the earthquake in Haiti, the quake-ravaged country still had a few hours of daylight left and temperatures in the mid-80s, a perfect combination for a cholera outbreak. Because of the delay in providing clean drinking water to the masses, a cholera outbreak ensued, killing over 6,000 people. According to an article in the Lancet, another 90,000 people have been infected.\n\nAfter Haiti, there was a rash of media coverage on this vicious pathogen and the need for preparedness. Yet now, with the recent massive earthquake in Japan, reports are indicating that the number of cholera cases has been minimal. With a recent article in The New York Times, Dr. Atul Gawande, the author of The Checklist Manifesto, offers some lessons from Haiti.\n\nLesson #1: Time is the critical factor in controlling an outbreak.\n\nFor every hour in Haiti that people didn’t have access to clean water, the number of people with cholera doubled. In Japan, the delays in getting help to the masses have been measured in hours, not days. While both countries have been crippled by disaster, there was a small window for a clean water initiative to take hold in Japan.\n\nLesson #2: The best public health tools are not going to be available.\n\nThere was very little to no waste management in Haiti before the earthquake. In Haiti, the stench of the putrid garbage hanging in the air was even worse than the stench of the open sewage. During a disaster, the waste management is in shambles. After a natural disaster, your best option for waste management may be nothing.\n\nLesson #3: Lead, follow, or get out of the way.\n\nAfter the earthquake, the initial response by the Haitians was self-help, not government response. The government was just as incapacitated as the rest of the people and in some cases, people said that it made matters worse. As noted in this article, the first responders were the Haitians themselves. Then the international community, led by the United States, stepped in and began to take over.\n\nLesson #4: Be more pragmatic.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) declared cholera to be a global epidemic and established an emergency response plan for countries around the world. Haiti was on the list of countries to receive support. That response was to install hand pumps to collect water. The problem is that only about half of the pumps had been installed when the earthquake struck. In Haiti, the people said that they were more than happy to have the hand pumps installed, but they didn’t need them until after the earthquake.\n\nLesson #5: People’s lives will be saved in Haiti and Japan by leveraging the private sector.\n\nIn Haiti, many non-governmental organizations did not have enough money to fund their projects. At the same time, the countries did not have the money to fund the projects. They worked together and leveraged private funding to fund the project and then provide technical support to run the project.\n\nLesson #6: Don’t make the people in need the focus.\n\nThe focus in Haiti was on cholera. It became the priority of the Haitian government to address the disease. The result was that the Haitian people had to wait for government support.\n\nLesson #7: Planning for disaster is the best insurance against the future.\n\nWe must plan for the worst case scenario and hope for the best case scenario. If we only plan for the best case scenario, we will be unprepared for the worst case scenario. A well-planned disaster response will limit the chances of a long-term disaster.\n\nLesson #8: A “quick” solution can become the long-term problem.\n\nIn Haiti, the quick fix was for the cholera outbreak was to spray bleach to sterilize the water. Unfortunately, the bleach only helps if the water is highly contaminated. Even if it was highly contaminated, the Haitians only needed to boil the water for a few minutes to make it safe for drinking. The irony of spraying bleach on the water was that it could have been a good solution to help in a later stage. In Japan, water from the tsunami is being sterilized to be safe for drinking. Once again, the quick fix could have been a good long-term solution.\n\nLesson #9: There is no such thing as a quick fix.\n\nWith the influx of money and help from the international community, the Haitian government quickly put together a program that was supposed to provide clean water to everyone in the affected area. That program was estimated to cost $20 million. There were 6,000 people living in tent camps who needed clean water. After seven months, the project was abandoned with only a handful of people getting clean water. There is no such thing as a quick fix in Haiti.\n\nLesson #10: Money, money, money.\n\nThe primary reason that the water program was abandoned was money. It was simply too expensive to provide clean water to all the Haitians.\n\nLesson #11: Don’t start with the simple stuff.\n\nHaiti needed more than clean water. It needed medical care, food, shelter, and protection. Clean water may have been something that could have been added after the situation was stabilized.\n\nLesson #12: Waiting is never the answer.\n\nHaiti will need at least $5 billion to rebuild. The wait for that money could take years. They will need it now. That is what happens when you have a country with over 70 percent of the population living on less than $2 a day.\n\nLesson #13: The human spirit is strong.\n\nPeople in Haiti persevered through the disaster. That is what I admire most about them. They are a very resilient people.\n\nLesson #14: We need to prepare for the next disaster.\n\nHow do you prepare for the next disaster? The best way is to have a ready supply of ready to use water stored at home. The next best way is to have your own filtration system. Then you can make sure your family has clean water in the event of a disaster.\n\nThe best way to prepare is to have enough water to last at least three days. You may not be able to find bottled water or you may not have time to boil your water. It is good to have enough water to survive the first few days without having to depend on bottled water or someone else.\n\nDo you think we are prepared for the next disaster?\n\n[Image by U.S. Navy Photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Janelle W.
