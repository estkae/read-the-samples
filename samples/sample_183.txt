EAT-25 Test System\n\nThe Panasonic EAT-25 Test System is a complete one-box system for testing audio/video (A/V) signals, enabling designers of A/V equipment to perform critical measurements quickly and conveniently.\n\nOur comprehensive system includes EZ-25A and EZ-19A signal generators, both of which can generate the same high-quality A/V test signals, EZ-D9A dual digital pattern generator, EZ-10R high-speed data pattern recorder, and EZ-S8 data logger. You can use the system in your own lab or rent it on a daily or monthly basis through our worldwide sales network.\n\nEZ-25A\n\nThe EZ-25A signal generator can generate a wide range of test signals and is the perfect solution for designers who need to generate test signals for A/V equipment such as digital receivers, AV power amplifiers, etc.\n\nEZ-19A\n\nThe EZ-19A signal generator is ideal for designers who need to generate video test signals for the latest A/V equipment such as liquid-crystal displays (LCD), plasma displays, etc. It is also ideal for assessing test and measurement capabilities for other equipment such as laser displays and printers.\n\nEZ-D9A\n\nThe EZ-D9A is a dual digital pattern generator that can generate high-quality A/V test signals. It is ideal for use in the development of portable AV devices, as well as for assessment of measurement capabilities for other devices such as printers, etc.\n\nEZ-10R\n\nThe EZ-10R high-speed data pattern recorder is a flexible test system that can record high-speed data patterns, as well as graphic images. It can be used to measure jitter and data loss that is occurring during transmission of A/V signals, and is ideal for measuring the performance of external data-compression devices.\n\nEZ-S8\n\nThe EZ-S8 data logger can record signals such as sound and video. It is ideal for users who want to log events such as sound and video in a non-stop mode.
