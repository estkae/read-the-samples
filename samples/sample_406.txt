The former CEO of St. Louis-based Boeing said he will plead guilty to charges that he approved the improper use of millions of dollars in company funds on home furnishings, a casino and a separate investor-relations matter.\n\nThomas W. Jones, 67, was charged with approving improper expenditures at the request of his predecessor as CEO, Philip M. Condit, 63.\n\nBoeing Co. fired both men after the company's internal investigation uncovered what prosecutors called "improper and illegal conduct."\n\nProsecutors said that, in addition to Condit, four other Boeing executives and a Chicago interior designer would plead guilty to various charges related to the kickback scheme.\n\nJones and Condit each face up to 10 years in prison and fines of $250,000 on the conspiracy charge. The other defendants face up to five years in prison and $250,000 fines.\n\n'Systemic fraud'\n\nU.S. Attorney James A. Graves Jr. described the alleged conspiracy as "systemic fraud."\n\n"This was a company that had an ethical culture, and we find it deeply disturbing that a company like that could have employees commit such fraudulent acts," he said.\n\nCondit, Boeing's former chief operating officer, said in a statement that he agreed to plead guilty "to the company's disappointment, but to help resolve the situation and put this issue behind us."\n\nA number of the alleged kickbacks involved funds that were earmarked for aircraft engine development, according to the criminal information filed in the case.\n\nBoeing is based in Chicago, but the scheme occurred in St. Louis, which was home to its defense and space unit until 2003, when the company moved it to Washington state.\n\nBoeing spokeswoman Bonnie Rodney said Friday that the company has cooperated with authorities and overhauled its expense approval procedures. She said the company is not aware of any illegal expenses related to the company's government contracts.\n\n'Widespread misconduct'\n\nIn a filing Friday in U.S. District Court in St. Louis, prosecutors said that "certain Boeing employees, including several executives, had conspired to engage in the improper and illegal approval of corporate expenditures."\n\nThe filings said that Boeing officials believed there was "widespread misconduct" that included theft of company funds and illegal personal use of company funds.\n\nIn a "factual resume" filed in court, the government alleged that the executives conspired to authorize company expenses for a variety of items, including theater and concert tickets and interior furnishings for Condit's home, without any business justification.\n\nThe money was funneled through a design company in St. Louis. Prosecutors alleged that about $2.5 million was spent on the house, including $130,000 for a floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace, and $18,000 for a home theater with stadium seating.
