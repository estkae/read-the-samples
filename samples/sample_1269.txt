Since the 1970s, the number of non-profit organizations in the U.S. has increased more than 500 percent.\n\nToday, there are over one million, ranging from large non-profits such as the Red Cross, to the American Cancer Society, and local neighborhood foundations.\n\nMuch has been written about how they do things wrong, but very little about what they do right. In his book, "Benevolent Giants: America's Biggest Charities and Why They Do It," Stuart Rosenblatt, CEO of AspenPointe, writes that by examining the financial ratios of big non-profits, small non-profits can learn a great deal.\n\n"In researching this book, I found that the really big ones—the giants—have an enormous competitive advantage because they understand and execute a certain set of rules that the rest of us need to pay attention to," he writes.\n\nWhile the mega-charities each have their own history and distinctive missions, they share commonalities and major financial ratios. Rosenblatt's research finds that a large non-profit can raise one-and-a-half times as much as a small non-profit for every $1 they spend.\n\n"Smaller non-profits can use the lessons in this book to benchmark and improve their financial ratios and thus raise more money than they can now," he writes.\n\nA key to this book is to understand that while small non-profits may be small, there are principles that they can implement that apply across the board, he explains.\n\n"The basics of running a non-profit apply to both small and big ones," he writes.\n\nAccording to Rosenblatt, the secret sauce of these "benevolent giants" is the fact that they're profitable.\n\n"I've found that being profitable is a central, unifying theme of these organizations, and the one they are most consistently successful at implementing. The CEOs of these giant non-profits all seem to know that to build a big charity, you have to be profitable," he writes.\n\nThis success is due to how the big non-profits' management and leadership behave, writes Rosenblatt.\n\n"One of the great things about the really big charities is that their financial results are directly linked to the quality of management and leadership," he writes.\n\nTo read an excerpt from Rosenblatt's book, go to: http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobsullum/2014/03/14/in-book-benevolent-giants-americas-biggest-charities-explain-their-secret-sauce/
