The vaccinia virus is the only organism ever used as a vaccine that was proven to induce primary immunological responses against non-viral targets, including transgenes, defined epitopes of the target molecule, and single nucleotide polymorphisms. Vaccinia-based vaccines are being increasingly used for the induction of humoral immunity and as templates for the development of delivery vectors and vectors for gene delivery and immunization. In addition, the use of vaccinia vectors is growing in gene therapy, immunotherapy, cancer vaccine, therapeutic vaccine, and prevention of infectious diseases.\n\n\n\nThis book provides a comprehensive overview of recent developments in the area of vaccinia vector technology. It includes detailed coverage of all the available vaccinia vector systems including their biology, molecular biology, immunology, safety and regulatory issues.\n\n
