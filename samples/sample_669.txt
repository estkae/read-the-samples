By Melissa Nightingale\n\nAnxiousness during pregnancy is common, but doesn't usually come from a mum's partner.\n\nBut that's what's happened to Susanne* and after a few years of problems with anxiety, the stress of her partner's anxiety is causing trouble for her pregnancy.\n\nThe 35-year-old from Queensland was the one in her relationship who had been suffering with anxiety in the past, but it has now changed as her partner has become more anxious over time.\n\n"I used to be the anxious one, and he used to be the calming one," Susanne said.\n\n"We used to come home from work and I'd have a bit of wine, and he'd say 'have a glass of water'.\n\n"He used to be the one who'd be able to talk me down, and I'd always be the one to say 'let's not worry about it, it's not worth it'."\n\nIt started when Susanne started a new job.\n\nShe said at first it was hard to find a full-time job after studying for a Master of Education.\n\n"I'd go for a job and think, 'oh that's alright, but it's not the job for me'," she said.\n\n"I wasn't getting anywhere, and he was getting really anxious about it.\n\n"I was getting anxious about it too, but I just said 'this is the way it is, it's going to take time'."\n\nSusanne said he was the one who had a hard time, but she didn't have a lot of problems in that time.\n\n"I found it a bit difficult to find a job, but I'm quite a confident person," she said.\n\n"He became very stressed. He's a type A personality and is very good with working things out.\n\n"He'd ask me 'do you think you're going to get a job soon?' and I'd say 'I don't know, hopefully'.\n\n"I'd start to get anxious about it and I wouldn't want to talk about it because I didn't want to bring him down."\n\nWhen Susanne was looking for jobs, she wanted to take the job in Melbourne as it was closer to her partner's family.\n\nHer partner agreed, and as they were living with his parents in their country home at the time, he went to Melbourne to work while Susanne remained in Brisbane.\n\nBut after some time, the couple started to feel it was the wrong decision.\n\n"When he went to Melbourne, he just kept working and working, and he's such a hard worker and he would just keep working all day and all night," Susanne said.\n\n"He didn't really like Melbourne either, it's a hard place.\n\n"He was on his own there and he got very lonely and missed his family and I didn't want to go down to Melbourne because I thought I wouldn't see him as much, so we decided to move to the Gold Coast."\n\nBut with a baby on the way, Susanne said she feels like she is going to be moving around a lot in the next two years.\n\n"It's pretty hard to have a baby when you're living with your parents and it's just me and him, and when we move into our own house, I don't know how we'll manage," she said.\n\n"It's been really hard and he's been stressed and anxious a lot.\n\n"He used to be the one who said everything would be OK, but now he just worries about everything."\n\nAfter becoming pregnant, Susanne said her partner had a lot of problems with their financial situation.\n\n"He said 'I'm really worried about our finances' and I said 'it's fine, we'll be alright'," she said.\n\n"But he got a bit anxious and it started to rub off on me.\n\n"We would talk about money a lot, and he would go to his parents and get a lot of advice.\n\n"I didn't really mind talking about it and he would get stressed about it, but I'm the type of person who doesn't really care."\n\nSusanne said she would find her partner on the phone to his mum "constantly", and he would get more and more anxious about things.\n\n"It really started to affect me and it was hard," she said.\n\n"He didn't say 'sorry I'm a bit stressed' or 'I need some time to myself' - he would just carry on.\n\n"When I was pregnant, I had a really hard time because I was pregnant and it was hard to do things, and I didn't want to be"
