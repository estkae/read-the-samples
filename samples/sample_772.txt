"Fold the candy cane in half, with the sticks down, so that the seam of the candy cane lies along the middle of the folded portion.\n\nLay the chocolate into the mold (you can use a spoon to help push it down).\n\nPlace a dab of white icing in the center of the mold to act as a glue to hold the candy cane on the side of the mold.\n\nPlace the candy cane on the chocolate and gently push it down so that the seam is showing on the sides.\n\nDab a tiny amount of icing onto the ends of the candy cane to cover the tip. This is optional, but adds a nice touch.\n\nDab the rest of the icing on top of the candy cane, using as little as possible, and spread it around so that it covers the sides of the candy cane.\n\nPlace the candy cane mold on a wire rack and allow it to dry for 1-2 hours.\n\nRemove the mold and gently peel it off of the candy cane.
