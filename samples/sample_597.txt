San Fernando Street Circuit\n\nThe San Fernando Street Circuit (Spanish: "Circuito de la Calle San Fernando") is a street circuit in the Puerto Rican capital city of San Juan. The 1.8Â km (1.1 mile) long circuit runs through the city's Condado and Miramar districts, beginning at Ashford Avenue, crossing the length of Ashford Avenue, going along the beach in front of the Sheraton Hotel, and ending at the Conrad San Juan Condado Plaza Hotel. The track is made up of city streets and is laid out in a clockwise direction.\n\nIn 1986, with the purpose of developing a Formula One event in the Americas, the Tourism Development Fund (FDF) carried out the studies and groundwork to design a track similar to those used in Indianapolis, Monaco and Adelaide.\n\nA track was laid out in downtown San Juan, covering the length of Ashford Avenue, Paseo de la Princesa and Calle San Francisco. It crossed Avenida La Playa and the entrance of the Sheraton Hotel, continuing towards the Conrad San Juan Condado Plaza Hotel. After two years, this would become the first Formula One circuit in the Caribbean. The event, organized by the FDF, was held in the month of October. It was only the second race of the season, held in Latin America, and the third race of the season in the Americas. The first race was held in Brazil and the second race in Mexico.\n\nThe first race was held on October 9, 1988 and was won by Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna. The event was not particularly successful, and it was not held again. The last race in San Juan took place in 1989.\n\n
