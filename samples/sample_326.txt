Cluster switching\n\nCluster switching is a migration strategy for cloud computing, in which the users or services in a running system are transparently moved to a new cluster without disrupting their services or performance. It was first introduced in a paper presented at the 2004 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER 2004) by the same name, and published in Cluster Computing in 2006.\n\nThe purpose of cluster switching is to maintain system services even when a node or the entire cluster fails. Cluster switching is often used in parallel or distributed systems where the nodes are not permanently connected to each other. In this case, it is possible to have one node fail without impacting the others. The challenge with cluster switching is that it requires the system to transparently move the workloads to other nodes without affecting their performance.\n\n
