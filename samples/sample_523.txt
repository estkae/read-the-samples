Olympic Champion Jazmin Carlin had a successful return to racing on the World Cup circuit this weekend, winning a silver medal in the 50m backstroke and claiming two more top-3 finishes in the 200m individual medley and 50m freestyle.\n\nCarlin, a Manchester born-and-bred athlete who moved to Wales to train with the Welsh Academy, produced a stunning performance in the 50m backstroke, finishing just over a second behind American world-record holder Kathleen Baker.\n\nA week earlier she had set a new British record of 26.06 seconds at the British Championships, setting up a superb start to the 2018 season.\n\nEarlier in the week, Carlin also clocked a lifetime best in the 200m individual medley in Glasgow. Her swim of 2:14.50 is her fastest ever 200m medley in a year that she is targeting selection for the European Championships.\n\n“I came into this season knowing that I am going to be racing in the 100m and 200m individual medley in the European Championships and this is the event that I am training for so this was a good start,” said Carlin.\n\n“I am not usually a 200m medley swimmer but my best event is the 100m backstroke and, when it came to a race choice, I am always going to take the backstroke so I was just pleased to go under 2:15, as it is my personal best.”\n\nCarlin also set a new British 50m backstroke record of 26.21 seconds in the heats and the semifinals.\n\n“I got a bit stuck with people in the first 50m of the race,” she said.\n\n“I couldn’t get going but I knew I had to make a push in the last 25m."
