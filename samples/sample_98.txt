To compare the electrochemistry of a one-step and a two-step biosynthetic pathway, the co-culture of methanogenic archaea and the acetogenic bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens was examined. Acetate production from glucose in batch culture was investigated, comparing cells from co-culture with pure B. fibrisolvens and pure Methanosarcina barkeri cells. After 22 h, glucose was depleted in pure M. barkeri cultures but acetate production was not complete. After 22 h, glucose was depleted and glucose uptake and acetate production were completely ceased in pure B. fibrisolvens cultures. When cells from the two pure cultures were co-cultured, the cells from M. barkeri appeared dead in the co-culture after approximately 10 h. Cell growth and acetate production occurred in the co-culture, but was lower than the growth rate and the acetate yield in pure B. fibrisolvens cultures. Pure M. barkeri cells grown with pure B. fibrisolvens cells exhibited no growth after 8 h, but some cells were still viable. However, after 18 h all M. barkeri cells were dead and the co-culture was dominated by pure B. fibrisolvens cells. The results indicated that co-culturing of M. barkeri cells with B. fibrisolvens was not an efficient way of acetate production. Acetate production was possible when pure B. fibrisolvens cells were first grown to a certain population and then M. barkeri cells were added. However, complete utilization of glucose was not possible in such co-culture. In this study, the electrode setup was not optimized to detect early anaerobic cells.
