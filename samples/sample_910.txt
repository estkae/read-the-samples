"One way to manage the first challenge is to leverage the power of strategic framing. That's a fancy term for influencing the lens through which people interpret a situation. The notion of strategic framing is not new; businesses and political campaigns have used it for years. Consider how both candidates approached the national debt: Obama's framing was debt as a "ticking time bomb"; Romney's was that a healthy economy will help reduce it.\n\nWhich of the two frames resonates with you more? Or more importantly, which of the two frames would make you want to vote for the person who used it?\n\nWhile both frames provide information that is factual, only one frame is powerful enough to be effective. The important thing is not which frame you personally agree with, but which frame the audience responds to. After all, the audience votes.\n\nIn our work with business leaders, we've discovered that as they grow in their career, they often become victims of their own success. As they accumulate more responsibilities, they are exposed to more and more complex issues. As they work through these complex issues, they create new solutions that provide competitive advantage to their companies. Unfortunately, these solutions are often misunderstood by the audience. Sometimes, they are actively opposed because of miscommunication or misinterpretation. And that's when a leader's work goes from bad to worse.\n\nThis doesn't mean that a leader needs to dumb down his or her message or spend more time with the audience. It means that a leader needs to reframe the situation or issue so that it can be understood and supported. And the best time to do this is before you put a solution in motion. That way, the solution can be implemented and understood, not in opposition, but in support.\n\nSometimes, a leader's job is to effectively reframe the audience's point of view. That's how leaders lead. And that's how the best of them succeed.
