This week, Leonie and Rachel are doing things they have not done before: reading a thriller with their daughters. While the girls are out of school, they take a break from picture books to read some chapters of THE SCIENCE OF HUGGING with their respective five and three year olds. With its lovely illustrations and captivating illustrations of animals, trees, insects, and a variety of other things, the book provides a great introduction to science.\n\nIt was an absolute joy to see the girls absorb the information, ask the right questions, and share their thoughts with their moms about what they were reading.\n\nTo learn more about the book, read on for our interview with the author, Johanna Kindvall.\n\nDid you have a childhood favorite book?\n\nAs a child, I loved the “Little House on the Prairie” series by Laura Ingalls Wilder. I also loved the animal books by J.H.Hutchinson, such as “Are you an Elephant?” and “Are you a Bear?”\n\nWhat is your book about?\n\nIn this book, I show the science of hugging. Hugging is the act of embracing someone in a caring way. Hugging is a common way to express caring and affection. This book discusses many different types of hugging, from the ways that trees and flowers hug each other, to the ways that animals hug each other. I also discuss why we hug, how hugging can help our health, and the different feelings that we experience while we hug.\n\nTell us about a typical day in your writing life?\n\nI write every day. If I am not writing, I am thinking about writing. I have a lot of ideas for new books. I think about ideas and jot down notes. Sometimes I write at my computer, other times I write in my journal. I usually write from 8am-12pm, and then I go back to work.\n\nWhy did you write the book?\n\nI wanted to write a book about hugging. I was thinking about what kind of information about hugging would be most interesting to share with children, and I realized that we really do not know a lot about the science of hugging.\n\nDo you have an interesting story about writing the book?\n\nIt was so fun to illustrate this book, because I was able to illustrate a variety of different types of hugging. When I made the book I tried to hug a tree for the cover illustration. The hardest hug to illustrate was a bear hug. I had to really think about how I could draw a bear hug, and how I would express that the bear was hugging with his claws.\n\nWhat is your favorite part of the book?\n\nI love my cover illustration, because it shows so many different types of hugging. I also really like the science of hugging pages, because I was able to show the different ways that science can be used to understand hugs.\n\nWhat is your favorite picture in the book?\n\nI like the two pages that show how different types of hugging affect our bodies. I was able to illustrate the heart and lungs, and it was a lot of fun to make those illustrations.\n\nWhere can people purchase your book?\n\nThis book can be purchased on Amazon.\n\nWho is your favorite author?\n\nI really enjoy reading books by Linda Sue Park and Peter Brown.\n\nThanks to Johanna for sharing about her book."
