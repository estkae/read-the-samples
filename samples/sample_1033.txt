"Well this didn’t take long.\n\nFollowing his appointment as interim senator for New York after Hillary Clinton’s win in the state’s primary, Brooklyn attorney and New York City Councilman David Carlucci is reportedly dropping out of the running to fill the seat permanently, citing “time constraints.”\n\n“David has been overwhelmed by the support he has received, but his appointment has created too many time constraints for him to take on the enormous responsibility of this seat,” the Queens Democrat’s spokesperson told Politico on Tuesday. “However, his consideration is very humbling, and he remains fully supportive of all of the wonderful people in the district.”\n\nFollowing the win by the Clinton, rumors of the lawmaker’s appointment were rampant.\n\nClinton, a senator for New York, also served as Secretary of State in President Obama’s administration, the first woman to hold the role.
