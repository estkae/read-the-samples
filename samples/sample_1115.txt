Although this paper states that the Reserve Bank of Australia's decision-making model is expected to result in an increase in inflation, the model actually has no direct effect on the price level or on aggregate demand. Inflation and the price level are end-points of the aggregate demand curve, so in a model of the aggregate demand curve and its movements, the Reserve Bank's policy will have an effect on the level of inflation. This paper also says that the Australian inflation rate is more sensitive to unemployment than to the interest rate, but the opposite is true in the UK.
