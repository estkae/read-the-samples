"Look, when the playoffs begin, it is entirely about winning and winning only. Nothing else.\n\nNothing about trying to make a name for yourself, nothing about showing off your hard work, nothing about proving yourself to anybody. Nothing about personal glory, nothing about satisfaction. You get the glory if you win, or the blame if you lose.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. The desire to win and the desire to get personal satisfaction from your work are not mutually exclusive. In fact, you can have both and sometimes you need both to win.\n\nBut you can’t start thinking about that before you even get to the playoffs, you need to be purely focused on the business of winning the games and winning the series.\n\nNow, if you’re John Gibson, of course you want to win and you want to prove to everybody how good you are, but you can’t win if you’re injured, and you can’t prove to everybody if you’re injured.\n\nSometimes you need to accept your role and step aside, no matter how much you want to win.\n\nI get the feeling this is the approach the Ducks are taking with John Gibson. I don’t know if he is happy about it, I don’t know if he wants to be the best goalie in the league, but at this point, it’s more important for him to be healthy.\n\nBecause, for me, you can’t make the argument for the best goalie in the league when you have played only one game in five months. You just can’t.\n\nGibson isn’t an unknown, he is not a young goalie trying to prove himself, he has already done that.\n\nIf you are the team’s best goalie, you play. But the team also needs to be careful that they don’t go down that road again, with another young goalie, and another season derailed.\n\nThe trade deadline is fast approaching and the Ducks have the potential to acquire an upgrade at goalie, should they choose to do so. The Ducks have options.\n\nBut they also have a need. Cam Fowler is out for at least the next two months, and nobody knows when Kevin Bieksa will be back.\n\nIf the Ducks trade for a goalie and the goalie gets hurt, that could be a problem. It could be a problem in a different way if Gibson gets hurt.\n\nThe Ducks need to keep themselves as healthy as possible for the playoffs. And this might mean Gibson doesn’t get a chance to play at all in the regular season.\n\nThis could mean the Ducks bring back Jonathan Bernier. They are paying him more than $4 million to not play, but they don’t have a better option. Or they bring back Anton Khudobin.\n\nThis also means that, if the Ducks choose to go with John Gibson and he gets hurt, they are in a lot of trouble. The backup would need to be perfect.\n\nSo this is what I propose: The Ducks should start Bernier in at least 10 games, Khudobin in at least 10 games and Gibson in at least 10 games.\n\nBernier might be too expensive to play, and Khudobin might be too bad to play, but Gibson deserves a chance to prove himself. And if he doesn’t play, he’s not going to prove anything.\n\nBernier might be playing for his next contract, Khudobin might be playing to prove he’s still a viable backup, and Gibson might be playing to prove he’s still an elite goalie.\n\nBut if the Ducks can’t win with Gibson, they can’t win with anyone.
