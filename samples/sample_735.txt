Paul Kimmage has been acquitted of defamation by a Jury in the High Court in Dublin, after the long awaited trial was settled just hours after it started on Monday.\n\nPaul Kimmage has been acquitted of defamation by a Jury in the High Court in Dublin, after the long awaited trial was settled just hours after it started on Monday.\n\nKimmage, a journalist, who is best known for his three books on the Tour de France and for his work on RTE's Sunday Independent column, will walk away with costs after this costly case was settled out of court in such a short space of time.\n\nWhile RTE, the employer of television commentator Pat Kenny, whose Sunday Independent column Kimmage wrote between 2002 and 2005, did not have to pay a penny in legal costs as a result of the verdict, Kimmage must have been left wondering how he could lose the case after a long trial and having been supported by the "best defamation solicitor in Ireland".\n\nKimmage claimed that Kenny had deliberately tried to block his column from appearing in the newspaper, and this eventually led to him leaving his post as a columnist.\n\nAccording to Kimmage, Kenny had never made a secret of the fact that he disagreed with his stance on doping, but was able to do this while at the same time exercising his editorial control over the contents of the column.\n\nThe case was finally concluded yesterday, after being delayed twice, firstly due to Kenny's television schedule and then when Kenny was injured in a fall.\n\nKimmage's legal team had the chance to argue Kenny had defamed their client by stating in the Sunday Independent, in September of 2002, that he was anti-drugs and that his presence on the paper would undermine his credibility.\n\nA retraction of this statement was ordered by the newspaper, but only after a lengthy legal battle.\n\nThis defamation action was settled at the start of last month, while the case was being adjourned to hear Mr Kenny's evidence.\n\nKimmage's solicitor, Brian O'Moore, said that the apology was made in the public interest and a balance was achieved in terms of protecting Kenny's right to free speech and his right to a fair trial.\n\nHe said the apology had restored Paul's reputation.\n\nKimmage said at the time that the case had left him exhausted and had placed a strain on his family and his finances.\n\nKenny was not in court on Monday to give evidence, and the judge told the jury that he could not be compelled to give evidence.\n\nKenny is to broadcast his show on Today FM on Tuesday evening, and when asked about his absence from court, said: "I was in the hospital at the time."\n\nIn his opening address, the counsel for Kimmage said that Kenny's actions were "highly unprofessional".\n\nKenny was advised by his counsel not to answer any questions.\n\nKimmage told the court: "This is not about trying to upset or damage Pat Kenny. It's not about doing anything other than restoring my reputation."\n\nKimmage said he had been "decimated by the actions of Pat Kenny" and that his financial position had been "wiped out" because of the actions of Kenny.\n\n"I have been left in financial and emotional ruins," he said.\n\nHe claimed he had received a message from Kenny after leaving the paper that he had "betrayed the Sunday Independent" and that he was "going to take him to the cleaners".\n\nThe editor of the Sunday Independent said Kimmage's credibility was in question and that he was no longer a columnist that the newspaper could rely on.\n\nDenis O'Brien, the chairman of Communicorp, the parent company of the Sunday Independent, said that he was disappointed with the loss of Kimmage's column but he did not feel that his reputation had been damaged.\n\nBelfast Telegraph
