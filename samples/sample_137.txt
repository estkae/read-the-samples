more-in\n\nJust ahead of the International Yoga Day on June 21, the Gujarat High Court on Monday observed that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government's decision to declare June 21 as International Yoga Day was against the spirit of the Constitution.\n\nHearing a PIL against the Centre's decision, the High Court said that though there was nothing wrong in promoting yoga, but that should not be at the cost of other forms of physical exercise. The Centre's decision to declare International Yoga Day was against the spirit of Article 51A (h) of the Constitution, which emphasises on the promotion of scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform.\n\n"We will have to consider various aspects like whether the decision to declare June 21 as International Yoga Day is against the Constitution of India. A decision has to be taken as to whether scientific temper, humanism and spirit of inquiry is being followed by the Centre or not," observed Justice A.J. Desai.\n\nS.P. Tamang, the petitioner, had sought a direction to the Centre to hold scientific discussions before declaring a holiday. The petitioner also questioned the need for declaring June 21 as International Yoga Day and claimed that various festivals and events were already being celebrated by India on the same day.
