"A judge on Monday declared a mistrial in the case of a Utah mother accused of killing her baby by violently throwing the girl into her crib.\n\nMegan Huntsman was charged with murder in the 2011 death of her infant daughter, who died of a skull fracture and bleeding in the brain.\n\nBut Huntsman said the girl was in a prone position when she accidentally slipped and hit her head in the crib.\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune reports that a jury deadlocked Monday on the first-degree murder charge and two counts of child abuse.\n\nJurors had been deliberating for several days on whether to convict Huntsman.\n\nDuring the month-long trial, prosecutors argued Huntsman beat and abused her infant daughter over a long period of time. They also argued the child's skull was fractured and she was strangled by a shirt wrapped around her neck, the newspaper reports.\n\nDuring her own testimony, Huntsman said she did not remember how the girl's head was injured.\n\nDefense attorney Ed Brass argued Huntsman's "excessive" use of prescription drugs caused her to not recall the events surrounding the death of her daughter.\n\nAt times, she claimed to have little memory of the month the baby was alive.\n\nHuntsman was pregnant with the girl when she was arrested for killing another daughter born in 2009. The girl had died of pneumonia.\n\nHuntsman was sentenced to 15 years in prison in that case. She pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was serving a concurrent prison sentence when she was charged with murder in the 2011 death.\n\nSalt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said the cases will be reviewed by his office and a decision will be made as to whether Huntsman will face trial in the 2011 death.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report
