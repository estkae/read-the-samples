The Social Studies lesson is connected with science when we studied about the stars. It was during our “Geography” period when we saw the stars and some stars are planets. We studied that some stars have six or eight points and some have only five. We saw that there are two stars in the sky which are close together and one star looks like a triangle and it is called “Triangle of Stars”. It was the constellation called Pegasus.
