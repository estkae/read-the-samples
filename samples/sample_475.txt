Unemployed people who refuse a job offer will have their benefits cut under Government plans.\n\nThe Government will tighten the conditions which allow unemployed people to refuse work offers.\n\nWork and Income (WINZ) has been told it must provide greater support for people to get into work.\n\nBeneficiaries who refuse a suitable job offer will have their benefits reduced under new measures announced by Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Government plans crackdown on parents who won't work\n\n* PM takes aim at beneficiaries who refuse to work\n\n* Thousands of solo parents' benefit slashed under 'tough love' plan\n\n* More sanctions on beneficiaries as Government claims welfare reforms are working\n\n* Benefit sanctions have forced hundreds to quit job search\n\n* Beneficiaries told 'get a job' in get tough letter\n\n* Benefit sanctions 'designed to make you feel like you're doing something wrong'\n\n* No Job? No Benefit.\n\nThere will be exceptions for those who cannot work due to illness or disability, and those in serious financial hardship.\n\nThose who had been receiving a sickness or invalids benefit, such as the invalids benefit, the sickness benefit, or the severe disabilities benefit for at least six months in the past two years, will be exempt from the tougher requirements.\n\nHowever, all job seekers who had been on a sickness benefit for six months or more would be required to actively look for a job, even if they were on a sickness benefit.\n\nThe measures, contained in a Ministry of Social Development discussion paper, would apply to new and existing beneficiaries.\n\nThey would also apply to beneficiaries who are looking after a child under six months old, or a child who is in the "prescribed age range" of six to 12 months, or is aged under two years old.\n\nPeople with children over two years old would be expected to look for work once the youngest child turned two.\n\nBennett said jobseekers needed to be active and look for work, rather than wait to be told what to do.\n\n"We don't think the system is working very well at the moment. The policy is asking for more people to go into paid employment."\n\nThe Government is under pressure to get more people into work, particularly with a labour shortage.\n\nJob vacancies were at a 10-year high, but there were not enough skilled workers to fill them, Work and Income chief executive Glenys Coughlan said.\n\nThere were also not enough job offers to meet the needs of unemployed people, Bennett said.\n\n"We know there are around 28,000 job seekers who have been unemployed for a year or more, and nearly 30,000 unemployed who have been unemployed for at least two years," Bennett said.\n\n"We want to get these people into the workforce."\n\nThe Government's target is for 55 per cent of people aged between 18 and 64 to be in paid work by the end of this year.\n\n"This is a national problem. It's going to require a lot of hard work from all of us to solve it."\n\nThe discussion document is out for public consultation, and the measures are likely to be introduced in September.\n\nIf the measures are adopted, there will be increased reporting requirements, and consequences for not meeting work obligations.\n\nThere will be four levels of compliance measures.\n\n"Where a person is placed at the highest level of compliance with their obligations, it would mean that a person may be subject to reduced or no benefit payments if they are not meeting their obligations," the discussion paper said.\n\nPeople on a benefit would be expected to have regular interviews with a case manager, and have mandatory obligations to get training and development.\n\n"The expectation is that the person will be actively looking for work, and not sitting on the benefit," Bennett said.\n\n"They can say no to jobs, but they will still need to look."\n\nThose who refused a job offer three times would be placed on the work preparation programme. They would be expected to actively look for work, and attend job interviews, if they were suitable for the position.\n\nIf the person did not have a suitable job offer, they would be expected to participate in the work preparation programme.\n\nThose on a benefit who refused to participate in the programme would have their benefit reduced.\n\nWork and Income would also actively seek out job opportunities, and encourage beneficiaries to apply for the jobs.\n\nBennett said the work preparation programme would not be mandatory.\n\nBut "if you have two years of not being in work, you should probably have a little bit of pressure on you to do a little bit more".\n\n"I wouldn't want to see a situation where there was lots of sanctions. I think there will be exceptions."\n\nThe work programme already had a requirement for those who were work-ready to actively seek out work.\n\nThe changes were "very targeted", she said.\n\n"If you've been on a benefit for a long time, we want to make sure you are taking steps to get into work.\n\n"It's about saying to people 'get with it or we'll move you along'."\n\nThe tighter requirements for beneficiaries were part of a wider review of the welfare system.\n\nThe changes could see beneficiaries' obligations reduced if they were taking care of a seriously ill or dying family member.\n\nBut if the sickness was self-inflicted, such as drug and alcohol abuse, there could be tougher requirements.\n\nCoughlan said there was already a work-ready requirement for job seekers, but that it was flexible.\n\n"I think we're not as prescriptive as Australia. I think they're much more prescriptive."\n\nShe said it was important to keep the labour market up to date.\n\n"That's part of our focus, to make sure that we've got the market that matches up with the right skills."\n\nThere had already been a move towards a more results-based approach, she said.\n\n"We're already in the business of 'what are the outcomes for the people we serve'?"\n\nThe discussion document said the proposed measures would help reduce the number of beneficiaries, while supporting those who were genuinely unable to work.\n\n"It is proposed that these policy changes will provide a tighter fit between the requirements for beneficiaries to engage in paid work, and the exceptions to those requirements," it said.\n\nThe new measures are part of the Government's welfare reforms.\n\n"There is a real concern that people are falling out of the benefit system.
