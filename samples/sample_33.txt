And now, ladies and gentlemen, I give you the breathless high-speed ranting I did when I saw the (potentially) wackadoo conclusion to this storyline.\n\nOh, my God, you guys, this episode has a freaking atomic bomb on the side of it.\n\nOkay, cool. It’s the mid-season finale. I know there’s going to be some serious plotlines.\n\nAnd seriously, what was up with the weird science in this episode?\n\nNo. No, I did not just watch an episode with the headline: “Ouch, My Butt!”\n\nThat plotline was weird as hell.\n\nBut I can understand why they did it. He’s trying to be a “sophisticated ladies man” and not the boy they’ve been dealing with all these years.\n\nOh, now this is hilarious. But it’s also dangerous, if you’ve watched any superhero movie ever.\n\nIn the brief moment that I was allowed to breathe, I actually enjoyed this part.\n\nNot only is this scientifically improbable, but also… how does a security camera shoot a laser?\n\nI know this is only in fiction, but I do believe that they’re committing suicide.\n\nThis is also part of the reason why I wanted to talk about this episode. I know it’s not a good look. It’s not exactly smart of him to do this.\n\nI don’t even know what to say here.\n\nWHY?\n\nHe’s not afraid of bugs, but he’s scared of that snake?\n\nI mean, yeah, I get that he’s doing it for a different reason, but…\n\nIf it weren’t for that, then I would not have laughed so hard at this.\n\nOkay, look, I was done with this season for a while. I thought that it was becoming a boring clichéd plot that they were sticking to, so I was ready to say goodbye to it. But then I watched this, and I just felt like I was watching a new show. There was so much going on, and they were throwing so much at us at once, and it was just such a good use of time. I’m really happy that they had this show, because it was seriously pretty funny and it was also action-packed. There was a lot going on, but it was very clear, and it was fun to watch. I just loved how much was going on. I loved it, and I really did enjoy it. It was a bit much, and they took a lot of crazy chances, but it was just so fun to watch. That was some crazy stuff, and it was nice to see something so good after so much of the regular garbage we were getting. Overall, I loved it.
