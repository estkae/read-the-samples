Takes place three months after the events of Season 4, 'Brother's Keeper'.\n\nMax and Liz's lives were put on hold after George's tragic death, but now that the madness of the wedding season has passed, they're finally ready to start their life together. They've settled into their apartment, they're adjusting to working as a team, and even Chompy's finally feeling more like family than just another new roommate. They're finally back to their normal routine.\n\nExcept now, it's not.\n\nNow it's crazy.\n\nMax and Liz are supposed to be getting ready to take their first vacation in a very long time, but it turns out Liz isn't feeling up to it. She has a persistent cough, she's not sleeping well, and she's even started getting headaches. Max tries to be supportive as she talks about calling their doctor, but the more she says it, the more certain he becomes that something is seriously wrong.\n\nAnd then Liz stops talking. She won't talk to the doctor on the phone, she won't talk to Max, and she won't talk to the doctor when he comes to their apartment. She just smiles politely and lies to the doctor's face about how she's been feeling, and then makes Max drive her home as soon as the appointment is over.\n\nMax finally gets her to talk to him once they get home, but she can't tell him what's wrong. She just says that she's been feeling off, and doesn't know why. She refuses to go to the hospital, and eventually falls asleep on the couch, leaving Max alone to think about the phone call he has to make the next day.\n\nHe tells Hank, and his mind immediately goes to the worst case scenario. It doesn't help that when he went to visit Liz earlier, he saw a few of the guys from work lurking around outside their apartment. He had a feeling they weren't just paying him a social call.\n\nHe ends up calling Hank at two in the morning, rambling and stuttering and eventually saying it all in one long string of words. When he's done, Hank doesn't even need to tell him he was right.\n\nThe next day, Max wakes up to find Liz looking better than she has in weeks. There's a huge smile on her face, and she looks so happy. He's thrilled to see her finally feeling better, but he can't help but wonder if she's just hiding the fact that she's sicker than ever.\n\nHe can't bring himself to ask.\n\nShe starts working on her first assignment with a new partner a few days later. This new partner's name is Adam, and he seems like a pretty nice guy. Max watches Liz interact with him and can't help but wonder if he's doing the right thing by keeping her away from the wedding business. He knows how much she loves the job, and this is the first time he's seen her truly smile in a while.\n\nOf course, he doesn't get the chance to mention that to her. The moment he opens his mouth, she cuts him off and says she has a date with Adam.\n\nLiz goes on a date with Adam, and comes home late again. Max's heart sinks when she opens the door and he sees the smile on her face. It's not her usual smile, the one she saves for Max. It's the smile she reserves for Chompy and her art, and it's a smile he hasn't seen in a long time.\n\nMax knows what he's supposed to do, and he knows what's best for Liz. He knows that keeping her away from the wedding business is the best thing he can do for her. But he can't bring himself to do it.\n\nHe still isn't sure how she's going to take it when he tells her.\n\n"Oh my god," she says, and Max's breath catches in his throat.\n\nHe doesn't get a chance to tell her that he's sorry.\n\nShe rushes off the bed and takes the two steps necessary to cross the room. She throws her arms around him, and Max's whole body tenses at the unexpected contact. He can feel her shaking in his arms, and the sound of her sobs echo through his apartment.\n\nShe tells him she loves him, and he tells her that he loves her too. She pulls away, and he can see the tears streaming down her face. She says that she has to go, and he knows he has to tell her what he did.\n\nHe knows she'll be angry with him, and he's not sure how she's going to react.\n\nShe kisses him on the cheek, and then disappears out the door.\n\nHe doesn't go after her.\n\nMax calls Liz the next day, and tells her to come over to his apartment. She's silent the entire drive, and he's not sure what she's going to do when she walks in.\n\n"I'm sorry," he says, and she freezes in the middle of the living room.\n\n"I have something to tell you," he says, "and I'm going to need you to promise me that you'll stay calm."\n\nShe gives him a slow nod, and he knows she's not going to like what he's about to say.\n\n"I called Hank, and I told him that you were sick. That's why you haven't been going to work. I told him that you needed to take some time off, because you had a really serious case of strep throat."\n\nShe opens her mouth to say something, but he interrupts her and keeps going.\n\n"He didn't want to believe me at first, but I convinced him. I told him that it wasn't a big deal, but he needs to know if you start showing signs of weakness. He's going to call in a few days to check up on you. I told him you wouldn't answer your phone, and that's why he's calling here instead."\n\nHe sees the expression on her face, and he knows it's time to tell her the truth.\n\n"You're really sick, aren't you?" she asks.\n\nHe nods.\n\n"How sick?" she asks, and he knows this is the moment he's been dreading.\n\n"Very sick," he says, "It's Hodgkin's lymphoma. And it's probably already in your lungs."\n\n"When did you find out?" she asks, and Max can't stand to look at her. He turns away, and he's silent for a few moments.\n\n"I knew as soon as we got home," he says, and she goes completely still.\n\n"Max," she says, and he turns around.\n\n"I was afraid," he says.\n\n"You didn't have any right," she says, and he can see the tears in her eyes.\n\n"It was a bad idea," he says, "I know it was a bad idea."\n\n"What about me?" she asks, and he knows what she's asking.\n\n"You have to promise me that you'll stay out of the wedding business for a while," he says, "I can't risk you getting hurt."\n\nShe shakes her head.\n\n"You can't stop me from doing this," she says.\n\n"Liz," he says, and his voice cracks.\n\n"I'm not giving up on my dream, Max," she says.\n\n"It's not a dream," he says, "It's your life. It's your job, and I can't risk you getting hurt."\n\nShe shakes her head again.\n\n"You can't tell me what to do," she says.\n\n"I can and I will," he says.\n\n"We're not a team," she says, "We're not the Millers."\n\n"You're not the Miller," he says.\n\n"No," she says, "I'm the Keller."\n\nHe's never seen her like this before, and he realizes she's not going to let him stop her.\n\n"I'm doing this," she says.\n\n"No, you're not," he says, and he can see the fire in her eyes.\n\n"Don't tell me no," she says, "Don't tell me I can't do this."\n\n"I'm not telling you that," he says, "You're going to do this, no matter what I say."\n\nShe shakes her head.\n\n"I can't stop you," he says, "I know I can't. I'm not going to force you to do anything, but I am going to ask you to think about what you're doing."\n\nShe just stares at him.\n\n"You're not going to stop, are you?" he asks.\n\nShe shakes her head, and then walks out the door.\n\nLiz calls Max from work a few days later.\n\n"Why did you do it?" she asks.\n\n"I thought I was doing the right thing," he says.\n\n"I don't want to be a burden to you," she says.\n\n"I thought you were sick," he says, "I was just trying to help."\n\n"I know," she says, "And I appreciate it. It's justâ€¦I'm not really sick. At least, not anymore."\n"
