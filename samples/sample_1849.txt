IMA Training Institute began as an outreach of IMA Christian School in 1958. In 1961, IMA Training Institute became its own entity and is now one of the largest healthcare and training centers in the state of Arkansas.\n\nWe pride ourselves in providing quality healthcare and training services, along with preparing students for successful careers in our community and the healthcare field.\n\nIn 2011, we began an expansion project to help accommodate the growing needs of the community. In 2015, we purchased 3.5 acres of land adjacent to our campus for future expansion.\n\nAt IMA Training Institute, weâ€™re ready to help you fulfill your professional and personal goals.
