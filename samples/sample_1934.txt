Trump to Trudeau: I’ll go after Canada’s dairy farmers\n\nWASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has some stark advice for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau: back off from a trade dispute over milk or face a steep new tax on cars that is likely to make them unaffordable for many Americans.\n\nTrump tweeted Thursday that Canada’s protection of its dairy industry is a “deal breaker” for a possible new NAFTA agreement, sending the Canadian dollar tumbling. Trump says in his tweet that “we will not stand for this. Watch!”\n\nCanada has decided to protect their country by charging massive Tariffs to our U.S. farmers, workers and companies. Not acceptable! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 8, 2018\n\nTrudeau told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that his government is prepared to “defend our industries and our workers” if need be.\n\nTrump has complained about Canadian dairy tariffs for years, and this week took the unprecedented step of singling out Canada when he threatened to impose tariffs on the imports of U.S. allies. He tweeted that “change is coming!”\n\nTrump wants to change the two-decades-old formula for pricing dairy products that leaves the U.S. with a trade deficit. It works like this: the U.S. exports milk protein concentrate, which Canada converts into a product used to make cheese. In return, the U.S. imports high-priced, ultra-filtered milk, a protein liquid concentrate used to make cheese.\n\nTrump tweeted Thursday: “Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult. We will not stand for this. Watch!”\n\n…We will not stand for this. Watch! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 25, 2018\n\nHe has claimed that Canada’s tariffs on dairy imports keep prices high in the U.S., though federal and state authorities have said the Canadian government is not to blame for higher prices in the U.S.\n\nHe has complained about Canada’s high tariffs on dairy for years, but those have been in place for decades.\n\nTrump wants to get rid of the pricing structure, which is known as class 7, and believes that will help U.S. farmers.\n\nTrudeau has said he’s prepared to walk away from NAFTA if the U.S. pushes for a bad deal.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to walk away from NAFTA unless it is rewritten to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico, which was $71 billion last year, and Canada, which was $17 billion.
