"My plan was to drive from San Francisco to Portland, OR in 3 days with a couple of stops along the way. My primary goal for this trip was to shoot Mt. Shasta. Unfortunately, it was a rainy day in the Pacific Northwest when I arrived. I wasn’t able to drive up the mountain and had to do my hike around town.\n\nOn the first day of my trip I had visited Mt. Shasta in the morning and drove to the city of Medford, OR in the afternoon to stay the night. I had a lot of thoughts going through my mind when I stepped into the hotel room in Medford. For the first time in a long time, I was totally alone, there was no one around me, no distractions.\n\nMy day started with a beautiful sunrise above the clouds, which was nothing new, but it was what came later that really got me thinking. For a few minutes I walked through town and I saw several stores that were closed because it was a Sunday, or the employees were just taking a long lunch break.\n\nI’ve been living in San Francisco for a few years now and I’m used to the busy city life. There’s always something going on, and I love that, but at the same time it also seems exhausting to me.\n\nThere’s so much activity in the city, so many people, so much noise, and so many things to do, but you also get stressed out because you can never take a break.\n\nSometimes I just want to be alone for a while and be in the nature. Being alone in the wilderness can really change your perspective and make you rethink things in your life. I know that it has changed my perspective in a big way.\n\nThe next morning, after waking up, I went outside for a walk in the park near the hotel. I wanted to take some photos for a self-portrait project that I’m working on. There was a beautiful stream and I decided to take a walk through it.\n\nThe weather was great, the sun was shining and the air was warm. When I walked down to the water, the birds were chirping around me and I felt a bit stressed and anxious. But as soon as I submerged myself in the cold water, the sounds around me faded away and I was in my own little world.\n\nAs I laid down in the water and tried to float, I started to think about my life and my future. There’s a lot of stuff going on in my life right now, and I know I have to make some important decisions that will have a big impact on my future.\n\nIt’s easy to be distracted with things going on in your life, but once you slow down and try to focus on the things that really matter to you, you can start making some important decisions and steps in your life that will help you move in the right direction.\n\nAfter a few minutes I got out of the water, dried myself off, and decided to continue my walk in the park. I love it when the water is so cold that you can’t really stand it at first, but you keep going anyway. The first couple of seconds in the water are really hard, but after that, you can’t feel anything anymore and you feel completely relaxed and refreshed.\n\nSometimes you have to push through those first couple of seconds and make it past the point of no return, and then you’ll be rewarded with some of the best moments of your life.\n\nI went back to the hotel, took a shower and packed my things to continue my journey. Driving from Medford to Eugene, OR takes about 3 hours. I spent the entire ride thinking about my future and taking some notes.\n\nI didn’t have a concrete plan or goal when I started out on this trip, but I knew that I wanted to shoot some epic landscapes. I thought about how many images I had taken and how many photos I have stored on my computer, but I still felt unsatisfied.\n\nMaybe I was chasing the wrong thing? Maybe I’m not shooting the type of photos that I like to shoot, or I’m not shooting enough photos?\n\nBut after going through a few tough weeks recently, I realized that I’m shooting the type of photos that I want to shoot, and I’m shooting a lot of photos too. I just needed to look at the bigger picture and think about what’s important to me.\n\nThis is the point where a lot of photographers will ask themselves “Am I happy?”. I’m really happy with the life I have right now. I have a beautiful girlfriend, a good job, a supportive family, and amazing friends. I have a nice car, a big apartment and a bunch of cool cameras.\n\nBut at the same time I felt something was missing. I needed something else to get myself to the next level.\n\nWhat’s next for you and your photography? What are your next steps? What are your plans?\n\nI have no idea what’s next for me, but I know that I will continue to pursue my photography and continue to improve my work.\n\n“What would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail?” – JK Rowling\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nPinterest\n\nReddit\n\nLinkedIn\n\nMore\n\nPocket\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n
