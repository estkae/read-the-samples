Abstract\n\n[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST.] This study analyzes the psychological impact of an internship experience on a group of randomly-selected United States Psychology undergraduate students. In the summer of 2007, the internship experience was described as “cooperative” in the overall summary provided by the student. The study looks at a particular area of psychological concern (i.e., professional identity) through several different variables and dependent variables. It specifically investigates whether the student has developed an identity of being a professional in the field of Psychology, as well as an understanding of what is involved in becoming a professional in the field. It also looks at the potential positive and negative psychological effects that the student may have undergone due to the internship experience. The study seeks to determine if the internship experience has increased the professional identity of the student and what the student has learned from the internship experience. The study also investigates whether the student was satisfied with the internship experience and whether the internship experience would influence the student to consider pursuing a career in psychology. The study results indicated that the student’s professional identity was increased by the internship experience. The student’s knowledge of what it takes to become a professional in the field of psychology increased, as did his satisfaction with the internship experience. Additionally, the student was more likely to consider pursuing a career in psychology following his internship experience. The study provides insight into the impact of a psychology internship experience on a student’s professional identity, knowledge, satisfaction and perceived impact on considering pursuing a career in psychology.
