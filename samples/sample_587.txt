"You're telling me you'd prefer me when I was a glum, weeping, sickly, frightened little girl?"\n\n"Oh, yes," said the Queen.

It was the Queen of Hearts' desire that all subjects be on time and therefore she accused the rabbit of stealing her tarts. The poor creature was sentenced to death, but Alice interceded and the rabbit was saved. The Queen became suspicious of Alice and ordered her execution. However, the child escaped from the palace and the Queen's guards.\n\nAlice soon met the White Rabbit and they followed the March Hare and the Hatter to the cottage of the Dormouse. After a long conversation, the Mad Hatter ordered her servants to seize the White Rabbit and bring it to the trial. Alice entered the scene again and the Queen ordered her death sentence. She then asked for an executioner and it was the Knave of Hearts who came to execute her. Alice then escaped into the woods with the White Rabbit.\n\nAlice later met the Queen again, this time at the Mock Turtle's story. The Queen ordered Alice to be executed, but the Gryphon saved the girl.\n\nFinding the Red Queen Edit\n\nThrough the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There Edit\n\nBehind the scenes Edit\n\nAppearances Edit
