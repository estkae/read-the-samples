"I have been reading this book on and off for the past year and I must say, it is one of the best spiritual books I have read. It was given to me by a good friend, which I am very thankful for. The book was written in 1997 by Henri Nouwen and the title of the book is “The Genesee Diary: A Spiritual Journey”. Henri Nouwen was a Roman Catholic priest, a prolific writer, and a world renowned spiritual leader. The book is a very personal account of his time spent at the Benedictine Monastery in Genesee, NY. If you know me, then you know I am a huge believer in the monastic lifestyle. I have never been in a monastery, but I think it would be a wonderful experience and I am planning to do it one day. It’s funny because my little town of Seneca Falls has a monastery too. I have never been there, but I am not a fan of taking on debt, so when the time is right, I’m sure I will go.\n\nIn the book, Nouwen goes into great detail about his spiritual thoughts and beliefs, as well as his life, struggles, and doubts. He starts the book off by writing, “The monastery had become a source of great happiness for me. I was not yet quite sure about God, but I knew that God was the One to whom I was attracted in the monastic life.” Throughout the book he talks about his attraction to God, his struggles with temptation, his doubts, and his worries. He also shares his passion for the arts, music, nature, and people. His writing style is so vivid, and makes it very easy to imagine what he is talking about. It is one of those books that you just don’t want to put down. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
