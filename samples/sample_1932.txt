Retired New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez on Monday will host a conference call to explain his decision to file a lawsuit against the Major League Baseball Players Association, according to an invitation sent to reporters by his lawyers.\n\nThe suit, filed in federal court in Miami on Friday, alleges that the union withheld hundreds of thousands of dollars from A-Rod’s pension plan and health care program as part of a “fraudulent and unfair scheme.”\n\nA-Rod and his lawyers also will be available to answer questions from reporters on Monday afternoon, his attorney Joe Tacopina told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nThe Yankees' 2009 World Series title is tainted with A-Rod's ban\n\nTacopina said Friday the lawsuit was “a story about being a wronged employee of a corrupt union.” A-Rod alleges in the suit that union leaders orchestrated a plot to “divert hundreds of thousands of dollars from Rodriguez’s pocket to themselves and their favorite charities.”\n\nTacopina told USA TODAY Sports that Rodriguez was seeking $40 million in punitive damages and an additional $200 million in damages. The suit alleges union leaders worked in concert to wrongfully divert $200,000 from Rodriguez’s escrow account.\n\nA union spokesman declined to comment on the suit when reached by USA TODAY Sports on Friday.\n\n“We believe these allegations have no merit and will prove this in court,” the spokesman said.\n\nMORE: A-Rod files suit against MLBPA\n\nThe suit names Major League Baseball, the union and its general counsel David Prouty as co-defendants.\n\nA-Rod is one of approximately 400 players in the Major League Baseball Players Association’s pension and benefits plan, Tacopina said. The plan has approximately $300 million in assets.\n\nRodriguez is the sixth highest paid player in Major League Baseball, and his lawsuit seeks to recoup the amount he believes he was underpaid.\n\nTacopina said Friday that Rodriguez was “very happy” that the union leadership was out of his life.\n\n“It was a relationship that went awry,” Tacopina said. “He had a great relationship with Don Fehr (former union chief) and his predecessor Gene Orza, but unfortunately when Tony Clark (former chief) came in and was appointed as head of the union, A-Rod and Tony had a bad relationship.”\n\nA-Rod has claimed that Clark ignored him as a player while establishing a rapport with his union underlings.\n\nClark replaced Fehr, who left the union in 2009, after receiving unanimous support from the union’s player representatives.\n\nGallery: Yankees to retire Alex Rodriguez's No. 13
