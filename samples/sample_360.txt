Veggie burgers are great! The more veg I add the better I feel about my nutrition. Plus I am not that great at taking vitamin supplements. I do eat all the veggies I need though.\n\nMy first veggie burger was just lentils, eggs, and bread crumbs. No extra seasonings or flavours. They were ok but really needed salt. This recipe is so much better. I used this recipe as a basis but made a few modifications. I used 3 cups cooked quinoa, 2 cups kale, 1 cup spinach, 4 large carrots, 4 celery stalks, 1 onion, and 1 cup corn. I added a tsp. of thyme and 1 tsp. of cayenne pepper. I had a tiny bit of ground pork that I needed to use up so I also added that. I used black beans instead of pinto beans because I prefer them. I added extra bread crumbs and an egg to bind it. I think I put in 3 Tbs. of olive oil as well.\n\nI am happy with the result. The texture is really nice and the flavour is delicious! I served it with some sriracha mayo that I made. YUM!\n\nAdvertisements
