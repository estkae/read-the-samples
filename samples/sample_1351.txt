I have a Bachelor’s degree in Voice from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I have been in show business for as long as I can remember. I’ve been acting since I was seven years old, and in many ways I feel that I was born for this job.\n\nMy father and mother used to take me on the set when I was a little girl. In the beginning, it was just little things like interviews or press conferences. As I grew up, I was constantly learning about how movies and television shows are made. Eventually, I started getting parts in movies, and this is what I have always wanted to do.\n\nMy life is based around my acting career, and I plan to keep it that way.\n\nWhy I Should be Cast as a Future Love Interest in the Movies\n\nFirst of all, I have an extremely positive attitude, and I love meeting new people. As you can see from my photo, I have a great smile and always enjoy getting my picture taken.\n\nAnother reason I would make a great future love interest is because I am an extremely attractive, intelligent woman. I have a charming personality and a bubbly, fun-loving spirit. I am also very creative and would love to work on projects where I could get involved creatively.\n\nI think I would make a great love interest for movies because I am an open-minded person, who is accepting of people’s ideas and opinions. I have a strong love for nature and animals, and I am fascinated by technology and science. I love comedy and enjoy finding new ways to make people laugh.\n\nI also love to travel and learn new languages. I love to read, write, and listen to music. In fact, I sing, and I would love to work on a project that involved music.\n\nI love to meet new people, and I love to laugh and smile.\n\nPlease support my petition, and sign the petition!\n\nhttp://www.ipetitions.com/petition/ilouiseasmyloveinterest/\n\nI’m sure you’ve seen some movies where the girl has a beautiful smile and always seems to have a good time. What if that was me?\n\nThanks!
