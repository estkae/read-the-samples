So, I never thought this day would come, but after several years of wrestling with this series, I have finally been forced to give up on it.\n\nI read The Fellowship of the Ring many years ago, and loved it. It was one of the books that inspired me to get into fantasy fiction. The author, J.R.R. Tolkien, was a legend in the world of fantasy fiction, and it was considered one of his greatest works.\n\nAt the time, I hadn't heard of this series. If I had, I probably would have thought "Ew, it's another fantasy book." It would take me several years to learn that it's not another fantasy book. This is the one that started it all.\n\nThe story was great, and I really liked how Tolkien put all his imagination into it, and wrote a story that was unique and innovative. The story itself was fascinating. I loved the idea of Hobbits, which are little people that lived in an idyllic area, with their own language and customs. This book had a dark side, and even the humor in it was dark. There was a lot of death, evil, and destruction in the book. That's something that stuck with me, even though I really didn't appreciate it at the time. I was in my tween years, and just didn't understand it."
