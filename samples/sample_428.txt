The Ultimate One Night Stand in the Square\n\nChapter 1: Proposal\n\nAs a bridesmaid, you're required to do a number of things that I'd never consider doing voluntarily. First of all, you're expected to wear a hideous dress that you've never worn before. Second, you're required to spend your evening catering to everyone else, acting as the host of the event. Most importantly, however, you're required to smile a lot and appear happy.\n\nAt the wedding I attended, everyone was happy, especially the bride and groom. I was happy for them, but I wasn't the happiest bridesmaid in the crowd. In fact, I was the exact opposite.\n\nWhy was I so unhappy? I wasn't the one getting married; I was the maid of honor. I was so annoyed that I was even standing up for my ex. We'd broken up last month because I thought he was cheating on me with a blonde bimbo named Summer. I was at the wedding because my best friend Alicia insisted that I go, but if she knew how much I hated the groom, she would have probably asked me not to go at all.\n\nAnyway, this was the part of the wedding that was pissing me off: the proposal. I was trying my hardest to hold back my tears, but I was failing. I didn't love him anymore, and I never would again.\n\nI glanced over at my ex-boyfriend, Blake. He was really handsome, but that's not what was important right now. He was going down on one knee and was about to propose to the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen.\n\n"Andi, will you marry me?"\n\nI cringed. He'd asked me the same question about ten times, but I was too busy being angry at him to remember. This time was different, however, because he was now asking the blonde bimbo he was sleeping with.\n\n"Yes," she said, finally accepting the proposal.\n\nAs soon as he slid the ring on her finger, everyone in the room erupted into cheers. I just stood there, my mouth wide open, in complete shock.\n\n"Yes, that's my girl," said Blake, "And now she's my fiancée!"\n\nAs they walked out of the church and into the limo, Blake leaned over and kissed her cheek. A couple seconds later, I lost it.\n\n"Bastard," I muttered. "Bastard."\n\n"Andrea?" said Alicia.\n\n"He just asked that whore to marry him," I said. "It was my turn. I was the one who should have been there. I'm the one who was supposed to marry him!"\n\n"Yeah, well I know that," she said, rolling her eyes. "But it's over now. You just have to be a big girl and accept it."\n\n"He doesn't love her," I said, "I know it. He was with her while he was with me, remember?"\n\n"Andi, I hate to say this, but it's too late now," she said. "He's getting married. You can't do anything about it."\n\n"I could show up at the wedding," I said, "and say that I'm his girlfriend and I'm pregnant."\n\n"Andi, that's insane," she said. "You know it's not your baby. You're going to destroy his wedding day if you pull something like that."\n\n"That's the point," I said. "I want him to feel the way I feel. I want him to feel miserable for a change."\n\n"Look," she said, "I'll go with you, but you can't tell Blake anything. If you do, you're going to be the biggest loser in the room, and you're going to lose your best friend."\n\nI hesitated. I knew she was right. If I ruined the wedding, I'd be in a lot of trouble.\n\n"Fine," I said. "I won't tell him anything."\n\nA few days later, I arrived at the church. The doors were open, so I wandered in. The church was completely empty, which made it look a lot bigger. I could hear some talking coming from the altar, so I walked in that direction. The first person I saw was Blake, wearing a brand new suit and looking like the happiest man on the planet.\n\n"You look so beautiful," he said to the blonde bimbo who stood next to him.\n\nI thought I would be furious when I saw her, but I wasn't. I was heartbroken and sad, but I didn't hate her. In fact, I didn't feel anything towards her. I was just jealous, and the sight of her made me remember how much I'd wanted to marry Blake myself.\n\nI walked up the aisle, ignoring the fact that I was completely alone. I sat down in the front row, and began to think about what had happened.\n\n"How did it happen?" I said to myself. "Why did we break up?"\n\nI knew that I loved him, but I was certain he didn't love me. My best friend Alicia and I had discussed it, and she agreed with me. She was convinced that Blake was cheating on me with a blonde bimbo named Summer, but I wasn't convinced.\n\n"It can't be her," I said. "How did he meet her? Where did they meet?"\n\nJust then, a woman walked up to the front of the church. She was dressed in a black robe, and she had short, black hair.\n\n"Are you Andrea?" she asked.\n\n"Yes," I said.\n\n"I'm sorry," she said, "but the wedding has been cancelled."\n\n"What do you mean?" I asked.\n\n"Blake is getting married in Las Vegas," she said.\n\n"But I'm his fiancée," I said, "And I'm supposed to be here."\n\n"You were never his fiancée," she said. "The bimbo, Summer, is the one he's getting married to."\n\n"I'm sorry," I said. "I don't understand."\n\n"Neither do I," she said, "but I was supposed to tell you the wedding was cancelled. So, that's what I'm doing. Sorry for ruining your night."\n\n"It's okay," I said. "It's not your fault."\n\nI knew I had to get out of there. I could barely stand being there as it was, so I hurried out the door. I walked down the sidewalk, not knowing where I was going. I had no idea what to do next.\n\n"Hey," said a voice behind me.\n\nI turned around and saw Blake running towards me.\n\n"You were supposed to be at the wedding," he said. "Where have you been?"\n\n"I'm not going to lie to you," I said. "I'm really hurt, and I don't want to be in your wedding. I'm just here because your father paid for the wedding."\n\n"You don't understand," he said. "We're getting married in Las Vegas tonight."\n\n"Really?" I said.\n\n"Andi, we've got to go," he said, "it's going to start any second."\n\nI took one look at his face, and I knew that he was telling the truth. I felt the tears well up in my eyes.\n\n"So, this is it?" I said. "You're really getting married?"\n\n"Andi, I'm sorry," he said. "I didn't know how to tell you. My father forced me into this, and I couldn't say no. If I had it my way, you'd be my wife right now. But this is the way it has to be."\n\nI felt a tear escape my eye, and I quickly wiped it away.\n\n"You look beautiful," he said.\n\n"I'm not going," I"
