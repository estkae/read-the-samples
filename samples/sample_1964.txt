The prayer breakfast that Congress organized to honor the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks has ended with religious leaders singing a rendition of “God Bless America.”\n\nThe breakfasts are being held this week on Capitol Hill and at the Pentagon, with Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Colin Powell in attendance.\n\nWednesday’s gathering at the Pentagon drew the vice president, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, about 150 victims’ relatives and others. It began with the public reading of the names of those killed in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.\n\nEarlier, the Rev. Billy Graham told the group that the country needs prayer more than ever.\n\n© 2001 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.
