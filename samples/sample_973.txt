I think they're gonna try to get more picks. Now, I think that's where they're gonna go. That said, there is a part of me that looks at them and says: I think they need a running back. I think there's a part of them that thinks: We'll see how the board falls. I could be totally wrong. But I feel like there's a decent chance, I guess, that they go up.\n\nWhether Washington goes up or down in the first round is only part of the equation, because they need to come away with a running back to finally replace Alfred Morris.\n\nLast season, Morris was Washington's leading rusher with just 751 yards. This offseason, the Redskins did not re-sign Roy Helu and traded away their other veteran back in Silas Redd. Washington has Matt Jones and Chris Thompson, but both have dealt with injuries.\n\nWhat's next for the Washington Redskins?

The Redskins are going to have a lot of picks this year, with nine of them in the draft. They also have a lot of holes on their roster, especially on defense.\n\nWashington is expected to target defense in this year's draft, with most of the talk revolving around a top cornerback. The Redskins also need help at linebacker and in the secondary, so trading back and drafting a running back wouldn't be a bad"
