"Anyone can help me? I did everything like the tutorial but it's not working, I downloaded the latest version, and it was 1.8.5, and when I installed the skse64 and opened the program there was a lot of green buttons and I pressed the "stop" and the game wasn't freeze anymore but the buttons are still there, what I should do? Sorry for my bad English.\n\n[Edited by ash-guy15, 11/21/2017 12:30:49 AM]
