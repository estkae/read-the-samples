Westwind Embroidery can design and manufacture embroidery on your garments, caps, totes, etc.\n\nThe first step is to decide what garment or garment color you would like embroidered. Please contact me for pricing. Next is to decide what thread colors you would like, and what fonts you would like for your logo or design. The next step is to take photos or a sample of the embroidery design. The design and photos should be sent to me at [email protected]\n\nOnce I receive the information, I will give you a price. If you would like to proceed, I will design and produce your embroidery. I will email you a pdf sample of your design. Once you approve the sample, I will start the production. You will need to place a 50% deposit before the start of production. The remaining balance is due upon the completion of the order.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to contact me at (360) 262-5679 or by email at [email protected]
