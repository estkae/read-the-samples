What can I say about Sweet Lou's Bakeshop and Cafe in L.A.'s Chinatown other than, well, it is a little gem. If I had to choose one thing to eat every day for the rest of my life it would be a quiche from Sweet Lou's. Seriously. When I went to the Farmers' Market on Monday I bought one. I bought a quiche at the bakery next door too but I'm not too sure how good that one is. But I am very sure that the quiche from Sweet Lou's is absolutely delicious. And it's made from scratch.\n\n\n\nLou is such a sweetie. I know he'd be a fun guy to have coffee with. He owns a gorgeous old school bakery in Chinatown and the smells of fresh baked bread and sweet treats are incredible. So if you are ever in L.A., and you happen to be in the Chinatown area, go on over and get a treat from Lou. You'll be glad you did. And he even has a menu for the cafe part of his establishment and everything on it looks pretty good too. I need to get over there soon and try it out.\n\n\n\nHis website is a little hard to find, I'm not sure if that's just me or if it's hard for everyone. But I did find it.\n\n\n\nI'm a big fan of Lou's pies. They look good enough to eat!
