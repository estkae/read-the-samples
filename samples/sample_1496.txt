Just in case you're wondering, that was the hottest day in the 30-year history of the National Weather Service office in Fort Worth.\n\nThe mercury hit 114 degrees in downtown Fort Worth and the average high temperature for July 19 is just 89.5.\n\nNationally, it was the hottest day since July 6, 2013, when the temperature hit 117 in Death Valley, California.\n\n"I was hoping the season wasn't going to start out like that," NWS meteorologist Butch Dye said. "A low pressure system was passing through the area and the jet stream was far enough north that we had a good shot at some widespread severe weather across North Texas."\n\nIn addition to the heat and thunderstorms, Fort Worth also recorded wind gusts that approached 60 mph.\n\nThat helped fuel the fire at Southwest Chute 7 at Alliance Airport. The fire started at about 11:30 a.m. Tuesday and burned 40 acres of land before it was contained at 4 p.m.\n\nDye said Fort Worth has experienced only six other days when the high temperature reached at least 110 degrees. The hottest day ever recorded in Fort Worth was 118 on July 18, 2012.\n\nTwitter: @gtraighler\n\nMORE ON THE HEAT\n\nWednesday's highs: 10 things to know before the heat sets in\n\nExcessive heat warning issued for much of North Texas\n\nRed, yellow flags fly as heat wave threatens to sizzle
