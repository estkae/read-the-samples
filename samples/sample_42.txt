(NC)—Despite the odds, there are some consumers who decide to head to the stores this weekend to start Christmas shopping. For some, the reason is because they still have some of their shopping list to complete. Others, however, have an entirely different reason.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, the average Canadian adult will spend $473.12 on gifts this holiday season. That means the average consumer will spend almost $35 more this year than last year.\n\n“A lot of consumers have gone overboard,” says Ted Michalos, founder of CMG Financial. “It’s not necessarily the spending that’s the problem, it’s what they’re spending the money on.”\n\nThat’s because many shoppers are buying gifts for themselves. That doesn’t necessarily mean they’re spending on the latest fashions, but rather toys and electronics. And the majority of these gifts, at 41.8 per cent, are going to be purchased online.\n\nHowever, the reason why so many people are spending online is because they’re trying to avoid the crowds and waiting in lines.\n\n“Some consumers just get too stressed and they go online to get their stuff,” says Michalos. “And if they do that, they’re likely going to be paying more for the gifts.”\n\nThat’s because while there are fewer people at the store, they’re paying more per person. For example, if someone is paying $50 for a gift in the store, they’re likely to pay more than $50 online.\n\n“This is really the time where you’re going to have to do your best to have everything done by the 15th,” says Michalos. “And it’s definitely a good idea to sit down with your spouse or significant other and look at your budget. And when you have a child, the best thing to do is to write down what you’re going to spend. That’s a real good thing to do, because if you don’t, you’ll overspend.”\n\nAnd that could come with consequences, because if you’re overspending, you could be limiting your ability to spend on your children or other family members in the future.\n\n“You can go overboard and give away everything you have to your kids and that could be a problem,” says Michalos. “This could be an opportunity to teach your kids about moderation, and also the difference between ‘I want’ and ‘I need.’”\n\nBecause with Christmas, most people are shopping with the mindset of ‘I want,’ not ‘I need.’ And that can be a problem, because it will prevent you from saving or investing.\n\n“If you’re going to be shopping on a credit card, you’re going to be in big trouble,” says Michalos. “If you’re not able to pay off that debt by the end of January, you’re going to be in big trouble.”\n\nWant to know more about debt?
