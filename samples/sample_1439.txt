I'd have to agree, I think this is one of the worst MH games ever. The first thing you notice is the graphics.\n\n\n\nI remember playing MH3U on my 3DS XL in early 2013, and thinking "Damn this is a great game. This is one of the best games for the 3DS right now." Well, MH4U was released just two months later, and then that thought was wiped from my mind.\n\n\n\nNow, I don't want to compare MH4U to MH3U, because there's a lot of things that are different in both games. But the one thing I notice about MH4U, and MH Generations as well, is the game's art style. It's really different.\n\n\n\nNow I'm not saying that it's ugly, but it's different. I was so used to the MH3/MH3U art style, that this new one just seems so... out of place. I think it could have been good, but it just doesn't look right, even on a bigger screen. And if you're playing it on a 3DS XL, you'll really notice how different the art style is.\n\n\n\nAs for gameplay, I feel like MH4U's gameplay isn't as good as MH3U. It's not that MH3U is "better" or "worse", but just a lot of things in MH4U are a bit worse, in my opinion.\n\n\n\nAlso, what really turns me off of MH4U is the lack of content.\n\n\n\nI understand it's a port of MH4G, but just, I felt that MH3U had so much more content than this.\n\n\n\nWhen you talk about the monsters, MH3U has all monsters from MH3, MH3U, MH3U G, and MH4.\n\n\n\nWhile MH4U only has some monsters from MH3U, some new monsters, and I think the Zinogre and Deviant monsters, but not much else.\n\n\n\nWhen you talk about the areas, MH3U has 5 different islands to explore, while MH4U only has 1, I think.\n\n\n\nWhen you talk about quests, MH3U has about 150, and MH4U has about 140.\n\n\n\nAlso, MH3U has a much longer story than MH4U. And that's what really makes MH3U a great game. The story is really deep, you meet new people, the characters are great, the fights are epic, and the environments are just amazing.\n\n\n\nMH4U's story is a bit different. It's a bit shorter than MH3U's, and there's a lot of changes in the story that I really didn't like. But I'm not going to get into that, because I don't want to spoil it for you.\n\n\n\nI also don't like the changes to the Hunter Arts, and the Styles, they're not as good as the ones in MH3U. I prefer the styles from MH3U over MH4U.\n\n\n\nAnd the Palicoes are also a bit different. I didn't like that Palicoes didn't heal you when you're in a team, and I really didn't like that I couldn't ride a mount in my first mission.\n\n\n\nAnd the Village is really different as well. And I didn't like that you couldn't take the Wycoon on quests anymore, or have them "join" you in a quest. I don't like that you can't just check the daily board and see what kind of quests you have. You have to actually travel to the Quest counter to see that.\n\n\n\nAs for things that are good in MH4U, there isn't much. I like the weapon upgrade system. I like how we can use stuff we get in quests, in MH3U, we can't. And I like that we can use the stuff from the Monster Hunter series in MH4U, which was something I liked in MH3U, but wasn't in MH3.\n\n\n\nAnd that's pretty much it. I know that I'm going to get a lot of hate for this, but this is my opinion, and it's pretty much what I feel. I really don't like MH4U as much as MH3U. MH3U is a much better game in my opinion.\n\n\n\nI still really like the Monster Hunter series though. But MH3U and MH4U are the only games that I play, and I just really didn't like MH4U.\n\n\n\nMy final opinion on MH4U? It's a good game, but it's one of the worst Monster Hunter games ever. It's not as good as MH3U, which I really, really like.
