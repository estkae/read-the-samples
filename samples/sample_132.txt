"Establishing a GitHub Account\n\nLog into your UCSC Gmail account. If you need to create a new UCSC Gmail account, visit this webpage. Once you have logged into your UCSC Gmail account, you can begin the process of creating a GitHub account. Please use your UCSC username as your GitHub username.\n\nTo create a GitHub account:\n\nIn the upper-right corner of the Gmail interface, click the menu icon, then click Settings. On the left side of the settings window, click Accounts and Import. In the lower-left corner of the Accounts and Import window, click Create an account. In the first field, enter your GitHub username. This is your UCSC username. In the second field, enter a GitHub password. This will be your username@github.com email address. In the third field, enter a password for your GitHub account. Please remember to remember this password. This password is only to access your GitHub account from the web. To access your account on your local machine, you will still need to use SSH. In the last field, enter your email address. This will be the email address your collaborators will use to send you commits and other notifications. Click the Sign Up button.\n\nYour UCSC GitHub account will be created. To access your new GitHub account, simply visit GitHub.com and log in with your GitHub username and password.\n\nSet up your GitHub Account\n\nIf you want to allow others to view or contribute to your project, you will need to set up your account to allow this.\n\nTo set up your GitHub account, go to the project you want to contribute to, click on the "Settings" button in the upper right corner of the GitHub page, and under "GitHub profile" click "Edit". In the profile settings, you will see the "Contributions" tab. You can change the settings in this tab to either allow others to contribute to your project or to view your contributions to others' projects. Click on the "Next" button to save your changes.\n\nGitHub provides a detailed guide for the contribution settings here.
