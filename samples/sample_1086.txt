Skills to Develop Explain the charge on a proton.\n\nThe electrical properties of the subatomic particles are useful for understanding the mechanisms of chemical reactions. These properties are a direct result of the structure of these particles, as well as the number of particles involved in a chemical reaction. An example of this is the net charge on a proton (hydrogen nucleus) and a neutron. These particles can participate in chemical reactions as positively charged particles (protons) or neutral particles (neutrons).\n\nParticles in Chemistry Some of the important charged particles (positively charged particles) in chemistry are listed below. Note that these are just a few of the many charged particles that are found in the nucleus. Nucleus Charge Electron â€“1 Proton +1 or -1 Neutron 0, +1, or -1\n\nParticles as Either Positively or Negatively Charged Particles A positively charged particle has an excess of protons compared to the number of electrons. A negatively charged particle has an excess of electrons compared to the number of protons. The rest of the charged particles can be either positively or negatively charged depending on the number of protons and electrons that they have. A neutral particle has the same number of protons as electrons. An example of a positively charged particle is a proton. An example of a negatively charged particle is an electron.\n\nNeutral Particles The electrically neutral particles include the proton, neutron, electron, and neutrino. It is the charge on these particles that allows for chemical reactions. For example, in a chemical reaction that involves an electron, an electron is transferred from one atom to another. It is the charge on the electron that causes it to be attracted to the opposite charge of the opposite atom.
