Four young adults with various cognitive and psychiatric deficits are investigated in a longitudinal study. All patients showed large improvements in neuropsychological functioning after administration of the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam. They benefited from the drug, but with widely different underlying pathologies. This shows the need for using individualized treatment strategies. The possible role of genetic factors, mechanisms of action of levetiracetam, and possible side effects are discussed.\n\nNeuropsychological deficits are common in various psychiatric disorders and epilepsy. They often improve with treatment, but little is known about the efficacy and safety of the various treatment modalities.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA number of psychiatric disorders are characterized by neuropsychological deficits. Neuropsychological deficits may be seen in schizophrenia [1], mood disorders [2], obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) [3], attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [4], substance abuse [5], and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [6]. These neuropsychological deficits may arise from different pathophysiological mechanisms, and they are often described in terms of aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or impairment of cognitive processing.\n\nThe underlying pathophysiology of these neuropsychological deficits is complex. Deficits can be the result of many different disorders, including disease of the brain, neurodevelopmental disorders, disorders that affect the central nervous system (CNS), or disorders that affect the body and are reflected in the CNS [7]. This is illustrated by the number of disorders in which neuropsychological deficits have been described (Table 1). In most patients, the neuropsychological deficits are caused by a combination of multiple different pathophysiological factors [7, 8].\n\nNeuropsychological deficits can occur with a variety of psychiatric disorders. When such deficits occur in epilepsy, there are specific cognitive deficits that are characteristic of the disorder [9]. When epilepsy occurs in combination with a psychiatric disorder, the cognitive deficits may be aggravated [9, 10]. When the psychiatric disorder itself involves cognitive deficits, they will also be aggravated. This will make the treatment of the underlying disorder more difficult. This will increase the risk of relapse, and may also increase the risk of cognitive deterioration.\n\nThe major types of treatments that are used for the various psychiatric disorders are listed in Table 2. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are one of the main forms of treatment for epilepsy. In the treatment of psychiatric disorders, especially when the psychiatric disorder is accompanied by neuropsychological deficits, AEDs are also frequently used. For these disorders, AEDs are often combined with psychotropic drugs. This leads to the question of whether AEDs may have a beneficial effect on neuropsychological functioning. Such an effect may improve the overall functioning of the patient.\n\nLevetiracetam is an AED that is registered in more than 50 countries and is licensed in the Netherlands as a monotherapy for the treatment of various types of epilepsy. It has been used in the treatment of a number of psychiatric disorders. A recent review [11] found positive effects of levetiracetam on neuropsychological functioning in psychiatric patients with bipolar disorder and in a subgroup of depressed patients.\n\nBecause of the poor efficacy of the currently used treatment modalities, the search for new treatment strategies is ongoing. In particular, studies that investigate the possible therapeutic effects of AEDs are useful. In the treatment of epilepsy, there are various AEDs that may have specific effects on neuropsychological functioning [12]. The clinical effects of AEDs may depend on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that are present in a particular patient [8]. It is therefore possible that different types of AEDs have different effects on neuropsychological functioning. This may lead to a personalized treatment strategy for different patients. However, no such studies have been conducted.\n\nThe aim of the current study was to investigate the possible effects of levetiracetam on neuropsychological functioning in patients with different psychiatric disorders. The study focused on three major issues. First, it aimed to determine whether levetiracetam may have beneficial effects on neuropsychological functioning. Second, the efficacy of levetiracetam in different patient groups was compared. Third, the safety of levetiracetam was assessed.\n\nMETHODS\n\nSubjects\n\nThe study was conducted at the outpatient clinic of the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands. All the patients were diagnosed at this center, and they all received treatment for their disorder(s). The following patient groups were included:\n\n1. Adults with bipolar disorder (n = 8)\n\n2. Adults with major depressive disorder (n = 6)\n\n3. Adults with OCD (n = 2)\n\n4. Adults with ADHD (n = 2)\n\n5. Adults with PTSD (n = 2)\n\n6. Adults with a variety of combinations of these disorders (n = 3)\n\nTable 1: Types of neuropsychological deficits in various psychiatric disorders.\n\nTable 2: Types of treatment for various psychiatric disorders.\n\nAll the patients were referred to the outpatient clinic because of their neuropsychological deficits. The patients were not selected on the basis of any specific criteria. All patients with a DSM-IV [13] diagnosis of bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, OCD, ADHD, or PTSD were included. Patients with bipolar disorder I and II, major depressive disorder I and II, and ADHD were also included if they were under the age of 18 years. Patients with PTSD and patients with other combinations of psychiatric disorders were included. All patients were between the ages of 18 and 65 years and were either male or female.\n\nAll patients were included in a longitudinal study [14]. During the course of the study, some patients were added and others dropped out of the study. Therefore, the number of patients included in the study changed over time. All patients gave their informed consent for their data to be used in the study. All patients received treatment with levetiracetam for at least 2 months. The following patients received levetiracetam for more than 2 months: five patients with bipolar disorder, three patients with major depressive disorder, and two patients with OCD. Patients were included in the study if they received levetiracetam at an average dose of less than 3,000 mg/day. One patient with PTSD received levetiracetam at an average dose of 5,500 mg/day.\n\nPatient data\n\nThe data on the patients were obtained from the clinical files of the University Medical Center Groningen and the files of the pharmacies where the patients received their levetiracetam. In addition, the patients were seen by the authors at the University Medical Center Groningen. The clinical file data consisted of demographic"
