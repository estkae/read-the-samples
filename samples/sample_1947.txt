\n\nBy Carey Roberts\n\nFor most of the 20th century, California has prided itself on leading the nation into the future. The dream of Silicon Valley came to fruition when the technological revolution boosted the Golden State into the front ranks of global economic leadership.\n\nThat dream has recently become a nightmare.\n\nA majority of Californians appear to be on a progressive march into the past.\n\nThis trend is reflected in the mindset of young Californians.\n\nThe San Jose Mercury News reports that a quarter of millennials want to return to the days when divorce was illegal. Another 30 percent of millennials believe that interracial marriage should still be banned.\n\nA full half of young Californians wish that government mandated segregation, and a third say women should not have the right to vote. And about 20 percent of millennials favor requiring job applicants to pass a literacy test.\n\nIt is clear that the dreams of millennials are radically different than those of their baby boomer parents.\n\nFor example, the same poll shows that a quarter of millennials are opposed to free public schools, which has always been a core value in California.\n\nYoung Californians are also more likely than older residents to see illegal immigration as a major problem. And more than a third of millennials say that they are skeptical of so-called man-made climate change.\n\nThe political expression of this progressive backlash is the Bernie Sanders campaign, which is running rings around Hillary Clinton in the state’s Democratic presidential primary.\n\nHere in Orange County, the conservative region once home to Richard Nixon, old time conservatism is in a retreat before the advancing left.\n\nIn March, the Orange County Register published an editorial calling for the abolishment of the death penalty, which is opposed by the majority of Californians.\n\n“But even if California reinstated the death penalty, we doubt it would be meted out. More likely it would be a political football,” the paper said.\n\nAccording to the editorial, the criminal justice system is not so much"
