Searching through the internet trying to learn more about who you are can be pretty hard. There is no magic pill. We all do our best to try and find out more information about ourselves. It is the internet's job to try and dig through the bullshit and show us some truth.\n\n\n\nWell I ran across a site that is called Freegene. This site contains an old test taken by Ancestry.com that contains 70,000 DNA matches and family trees. You can search and find family and DNA matches from all around the world. You can even contact people and learn more about them.\n\n\n\nSo what is my take on this site?"
