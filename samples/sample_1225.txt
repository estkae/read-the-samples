My 44 Spl Bull came with a double action only trigger and i was surprised how good it was. The single action was pretty good as well, but that was a big surprise as i didn't expect the single action to be that good, the double action only wasn't bad, but the SA was sweet.\n\n\n\nMy 22LR pistol, not so much. I really don't know what happened, it was decent for the first 50 rounds or so, and then the accuracy went down the toilet, at first i thought it was me, then i thought it was a bad batch of ammo, i bought 2,000 rounds, used 1,800 and then decided that i wasn't happy with it. It was a very nice pistol to look at, but that's about it, the trigger was pretty good, i was never really happy with the accuracy, it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. i tried different kinds of ammo, and ended up buying another pistol, i got a S&W MP22 and have been very happy with it.\n\n\n\nI've been to a lot of gun shows and have seen some cheap Taurus guns and heard that some people love them, i have heard that some hate them, but overall i've heard that they are fairly decent guns, but i wouldnt want to be the one to buy one. If i was going to buy a Taurus, i'd find a local guy that had one and test fire it, maybe spend an hour shooting it before i buy it.\n\n\n\nI'm with ArchAngel and the rest of the gunsnprings crew.\n\n_________________\n\nUS Army 1969-72\n\nARNG 1983-86\n\n\n\nLet me tell you the lesson I learned about fighting, it doesn't matter whether you win or lose, what matters is how many of them you can kill 'till you get killed.\n\nGeneral George S.
