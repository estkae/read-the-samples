Sci-fi Thriller Series ‘The Darkening Field’ in Development as a Motion Picture\n\nby Anthony C. Schembri\n\nWith the success of recent sci-fi/horror films like Annihilation and The Shape of Water, a new thriller that takes the sci-fi genre to the next level is being adapted for the screen. The Darkening Field is the first installment of a six book sci-fi/horror series by the same name, written by D.J. Butler. The author currently has three novels published.\n\nAfter being discharged from the British military due to a mental breakdown, Major Jack Ketch must uncover the mysteries of a huge field of dark matter while battling dark forces from his own past. With Jack at the helm, the book takes you on a horrific voyage into a bizarre and dangerous world that has a lot in common with our own.\n\nA film adaptation of The Darkening Field is currently being developed by director Robyn Eckhardt (The Haunting in Connecticut, The Call) and writer Nathaniel Hanks (The Mothman Prophecies). Hanks and Eckhardt are currently in pre-production on The Darkening Field, having secured investors and having begun the development of the screenplay.\n\n“We’re excited to work on The Darkening Field, a story that will truly resonate with fans of the horror/sci-fi genre,” said Robyn Eckhardt.\n\nThe Darkening Field is in the early stages of development, but will hopefully get the green light in the coming months.\n\nThe original Darkening Field novel is available for purchase on Amazon.
