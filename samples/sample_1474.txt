Back in 2013, Netflix began testing a feature that would allow its users to download select movies and TV shows and watch them offline, so long as the content supported this functionality. But on Wednesday, the company said that it's pulling the plug on this feature and won't add any new downloads.\n\nNetflix said in a statement to Variety that the company is removing the feature as part of an effort to simplify its mobile app. The company cited technical and business reasons for the move, including not having enough content that fits this functionality.\n\n"We know some members found this feature useful, but we believe it's better to focus on efforts that bring more value to the majority of our members," a Netflix spokesperson said. "Therefore, starting on January 13th, Netflix will no longer support downloading of movies and TV shows. We apologize for any inconvenience."\n\nNetflix said that the feature will be removed from the service as of January 14.\n\nNetflix began testing the download feature on Android in 2013 and on iOS the following year. Netflix was joined by Amazon Video, which also started testing the feature on iOS in 2015. At the time, Netflix had a limited catalog of shows and movies that were available for offline viewing.\n\nBut with this change, Netflix is removing a feature that's increasingly become less necessary. Both Netflix and Amazon Video have since added support for offline playback on select smartphones and tablets. Amazon has also added support for offline playback on smart TVs and game consoles.
