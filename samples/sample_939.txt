"There's no "official" cross-site book exchange system on reddit, so I'll just take it upon myself to try and get something going. To make it fair, you have to give a book away and get one in return. The only rule is that you have to have received a book to give away. If you don't have any to give away, you can still participate by accepting a book.\n\n\n\nThis subreddit is going to serve as the book exchange hub. There is a list of all participating redditors on the sidebar and a post to claim/give away books at the top. You are free to post your address and contact info here if you want, but it is not required. It's just as easy to privately message someone if you want to give/get a book.\n\n\n\nSo, if you're looking to get some books, feel free to post what you're looking for and what you'll be giving away. Also, you can post here if you have books to give away, but no one is currently requesting them.\n\n\n\nHappy swapping!\n\nLast Activity: 10-05-2013 07:46 PM
