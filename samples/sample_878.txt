It's a whole new world\n\nWhat's up with this new extra-deep vein thrombosis test, or P.A.T. scan? It's pretty cool. It's done with a special camera that can see deeper into your veins and arteries than x-rays can, so doctors can tell if there's any blood clots, which could lead to a heart attack.\n\n\n\nWhen you have a P.A.T. scan, you'll have to drink some contrast, a drink that has iodine in it. Then, they'll put a special catheter into your arm. You may feel a little weird when they put the catheter in, but it's really not that bad. You'll have to lie on your back for a while, and the whole thing should only take about 10 minutes. If you've had a lot of contrast in the past, you may have a reaction, so let your doctor know if you're worried.\n\n\n\nFor more information about P.A.T. scans, visit http://www.pat-scan.org/.
