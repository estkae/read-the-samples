Yeah, I would think so. I think they are looking for a couple of players to add on. We are trying to work out a "open tryout" with GDI as well.

It should be fun!\n\n\n\nBryan\n\n\n\n\n\nSat May 10, 2003 3:18 pm\n\nZoom Bam Addict\n\nJoined: Sun Apr 13, 2003 5:59 pm\n\nPosts: 609\n\nLocation: United States of America The_Phoenix wrote: Re: UF OTA Signup (?) open tryouts for the UF A team will be held on May 2nd, right?\n\n\n\nMay 4th is the UF v.

What I'm getting at is that I can't find out who's supposed to try out from the outside. Since you know who I am, you're the best source of info I've got.\n\nI know you guys like secrecy, but it's just that you can't do things on your own without any communication with the rest of the USWOA.\n\nCould you just, please, put out the list of"
