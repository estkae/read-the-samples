"To show their support for Venezuela, five prominent Tibetan Buddhist teachers from the United States will be joining a gathering in Caracas, Venezuela on September 24, 2015. The purpose of this gathering is to support the effort of the Venezuelan people to bring peace and prosperity to the country.\n\nWe will be holding teachings and prayers in three different locations. The first event will be held at 1:30 p.m. at the Cine Teatro Teresa Carreno in Caracas. This venue can seat 900 people. The second and third events will be held at the Jos√© Antonio Paez Theatre, which can seat around 400 people.\n\nIf you are in Venezuela, please attend one of these events. And if you cannot come in person, please join us in spirit by thinking prayers for Venezuela, especially during the times of the teaching and prayers.\n\nThis event is being organized by Geshe Tsultrim Gyeltsen, president of the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition (FPMT). He will be joined by other FPMT teachers, including Ven. Robina Courtin, Ven. Tenzin Chonyi, Ven. Tsondue Tsomo, and Ven. Marta Meana.\n\nThe event is being supported by the Embassy of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the United States, and the Embassy of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the United Nations.
