EAST LONGMEADOW â€“ When the spring arrived, snow was still piled in banks on the sides of roadways. Last year's drought was still firmly in the minds of those who had suffered through the summer with little or no rain.\n\nIn the winter, Gov. Deval L. Patrick was a frequent visitor to the state's east and central portions of the state as he toured the areas ravaged by back-to-back blizzards.\n\nBy the time the late spring came, it was Gov. Patrick who was looking for the rain.\n\nAs 2012 wound to a close, the state was mired in its fifth straight year of below average rainfall and an unseasonably dry fall.\n\nPatrick has declared that he's not optimistic that the drought will end soon.\n\n"I don't think it's going to be a good year," Patrick said last week. "And this year is not going to be a good year. Next year may be a good year. We're still looking at the effects of the drought."\n\nAs of Tuesday, less than 5 inches of rain had fallen in the state since the beginning of the year. At this time in 2011, it had been a little more than 9 inches of rain and two years ago, 11 inches.\n\nIn December alone, rainfall totaled less than 1/2 inch, while December of 2011 saw almost an inch and a half of precipitation and in 2010, it was more than 2 inches.\n\nThe rain, or lack of it, has helped to turn the state's streams and rivers into trickles in many cases and made for some epic mud holes.\n\nThe effects of the drought are also being felt in water levels in ponds and lakes, including Lake Pontoosuc and Lake Quinsigamond, both in the Longmeadow section of the state.\n\nIn December, water levels in Pontoosuc and Quinsigamond were at 18 percent and 8 percent of capacity respectively, both well below their historic low points in 1989 and 1997.\n\nLast winter, water levels at both lakes fell more than two feet and officials say it is unlikely that the levels will return to their average this winter.\n\nThe level of Lake Quinsigamond has been further reduced by the water department's decision to close the city's water intake pipe near the lake. The move was prompted by the city's concerns over the integrity of the intake system.\n\nMayor Michael D. Bissonnette said last week that the city had received "dozens and dozens of calls" from residents about the lack of water.\n\n"We have been getting complaints from people saying that their water pressure has been going down," he said.\n\n"We're still getting water. We're pumping from Westfield now. But it's been a difficult winter for everyone. It's definitely the worst winter I've seen in my 20 years as mayor."\n\nThe mayor said he expects that water levels will drop further as the winter continues.\n\n"Right now we're taking out of the lake as much water as we possibly can," he said.\n\n"We're running three pumps 24 hours a day. That's as much as we can do right now. But we could only run two pumps in the past."\n\nHowever, the mayor said he is optimistic that the water level in the lake will rise once the spring arrives.\n\n"The last three years have been the driest in history," he said.\n\n"We don't think we'll get a flood, but we do think the water level will go up."\n\nIn June, the state is expected to receive a $2 million grant from the federal government for emergency drinking water projects, including possible improvements to the city's system, which has more than 30 miles of water mains and more than 40 fire hydrants.\n\nBissonnette said he's hopeful the grant will be approved.\n\n"It's something that I think is a necessary project," he said.\n\n"I think it would be an improvement and will help."\n\nLike the other communities across the state, the city's water system is aging and is in need of repairs.\n\n"That's something we're hoping to address over the next few years," Bissonnette said.\n\nMeanwhile, on the state's northern coast, the tide at the Cape Cod Canal was rising Tuesday, bringing the possibility of a higher level of the waterway in the next few days.\n\nThe Canal is on the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency's list of water-supply sources in case the region's aquifers are depleted or in danger of being depleted.\n\nAnd this past week, the agency said that the last of four generators at the Mount Tom Pumping Station near Holyoke, which serves the Chicopee, Westfield and Holyoke water systems, was repaired and is working again.\n\nThe agency said that the problem that has prevented the pump from being repaired for the past month is being attributed to frozen water in the pipes that resulted in damage to some of the equipment.\n\nMeanwhile, Patrick said he hopes that the state will see rain this weekend.\n\n"If it's a big rain, it will help," he said. "But it's going to take more than one or two good rainfalls. We need more than that to turn it around.\
