Call me naive, but I had hoped that the small press comics festival last month might signal the beginning of a long overdue positive change in the mainstream media’s attitude towards and reporting on comics. To be perfectly frank, as a member of the comics media, I don’t think we do ourselves any favours with some of the reporting we do. I have long been of the opinion that the way some writers cover comics makes a complete mockery of the art form and is little better than a tabloid.\n\nSo, I thought that perhaps the passing of such an important date in the comics calendar would have been a time when mainstream media would have perhaps recognised the importance of reporting on the events in a balanced and serious manner. And indeed, for the most part, I think the mainstream media did report on it in an impartial manner.\n\nHowever, there were a couple of articles that I read in national newspapers which both fell into the same trap of making ridiculous sweeping generalisations and condescending tones, almost as if the writers were laughing at the very notion of people being interested in comics. The fact that it was in the London papers was even more strange, given that the actual festival was held in Glasgow.\n\nI’ve had enough of the ridiculous condescension and I don’t think I’m alone. So I wanted to remind all of you what the reportage should have looked like,"
