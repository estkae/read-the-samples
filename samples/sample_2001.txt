It had been operated commercially since 8 April 1957 by Alia Royal Jordanian Airlines, and had been named "Rafid". The aircraft had been withdrawn from service in 1987 and was sold to Eirjet shortly afterwards. The aircraft was used to carry passengers from the Republic of Ireland to destinations in the United Kingdom and Spain. At the time of the accident the aircraft had logged 24,322 hours of flight time, and it had accumulated 12,200 cycles, of which 6,600 had been as a passenger aircraft.\n\nThe aircraft had been repaired several times during its career, including repair to the front part of the fuselage in 1981, and had last undergone major maintenance on 12 April 2006. The aircraft had been given a complete overhaul before the crash. The aircraft had its last major inspection on 8 April 2006.\n\nFlight 4347 was on a flight from Faro Airport in the Algarve, Portugal to Son Bonet Airport in Girona, Spain. The aircraft was carrying out its third flight of the day, after two successful landings at Faro Airport. At 08:42 local time (07:42 UTC) on 27 July 2006, the aircraft crashed on a ridge while on approach to Son Bonet Airport. The aircraft struck the ridge at an elevation of , and exploded on impact, leaving little wreckage at the crash site. All of the passengers and crew died in the crash.\n\nThe cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered from the wreckage of the aircraft. The CVR was recovered from the wreckage with the cockpit recording module detached, and the FDR was recovered in two pieces. Both CVR and FDR were undamaged, and were sent to the United Kingdom Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) for analysis. The aircraft was fitted with a Honeywell Mark 541 inertial reference unit and a Honeywell dual ACARS datalink unit, which were both recovered in good condition. The cockpit voice recorder contained 85 hours of recording, including the last 30 minutes of the flight. The flight data recorder contained over 25 hours of data, including a detailed data block showing the position of the aircraft over the preceding 24 hours.\n\nThe flight had left Faro Airport at 06:47 UTC (05:47 local time) on 27 July 2006. The captain of the flight had flown the route once before, and the first officer had flown the route twice. Both pilots were well rested and met the requirements for the flight. There were nine passengers on board the aircraft.\n\nDuring the flight, air traffic controllers in Girona provided clearance for Flight 4347 to land on Runway 26. The flight was given landing clearance, and the flight crew contacted the controller, who provided the runway heading and the distance to the runway. The crew received a windshear warning shortly after the aircraft passed over a ridge at a height of . The aircraft was able to maintain its height. During the landing approach the crew reported that the aircraft was unstabilized, and the crew continued to work the controls.\n\nThe aircraft touched down on the runway before the runway threshold and overshot the runway. The aircraft had touched down at a speed of . The aircraft contacted a ridge, and began to break up. After the impact, the cockpit voice recorder recorded an explosion in the cockpit. Both CVR and FDR stopped recording simultaneously. The crash site was located on a plateau at a height of . There were no survivors, and the aircraft was destroyed by the impact and the subsequent explosion. The accident was reported to the local authorities at 08:51 UTC (07:51 local time).\n\nAn investigation into the accident was carried out by the Spanish authorities, with assistance from the Irish Air Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) and the AAIB. Investigators interviewed the survivors of the accident, and downloaded data from the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder. The black box data was supplemented with additional information from witnesses at the scene of the crash.\n\nThe aircraft had been on a round trip flight from Faro Airport to Son Bonet Airport. On the first leg of the flight, the aircraft had landed at Faro at 06:35 local time. The aircraft took off from Faro at 06:48 local time, and landed at Son Bonet Airport at 07:48 local time. The aircraft took off from Son Bonet Airport at 08:11 local time, and landed back at Faro Airport at 08:27 local time. Flight 4347 was scheduled to depart from Faro Airport at 08:40 local time, but was delayed by four minutes.\n\nThe accident aircraft had been checked by maintenance engineers at Faro Airport. Following the checks the aircraft was released to operate a flight to Son Bonet Airport. The aircraft's flight log showed that the aircraft had been operated on two flights since the check was carried out, and the aircraft had accumulated approximately 12 hours flight time on its third flight. The aircraft had accumulated a total of 24,322 flight hours, of which 3,700 had been flown as a passenger airliner. The aircraft had logged 12,200 cycles, of which 6,600 had been as a passenger aircraft. The aircraft was on its third flight of the day, and had been used to transport passengers on a round trip flight to Faro. The crew of the aircraft had been well rested. There were no injuries reported to the aircraft or any other aircraft that had landed at Faro Airport.\n\nThe investigation team reviewed the black box data, witness reports, and photographs of the accident. They also examined the flight records of the aircraft.\n\nFlight 4347 was on approach to Runway 26 at Son Bonet Airport when it struck the top of a ridge at an elevation of . The aircraft struck the ground with its landing gear retracted. The aircraft broke up, and the cockpit section, with the engine still running, continued to move forward after the aircraft had stopped. The aircraft exploded, and the remains of the aircraft were scattered over a radius. The remains of the crew and passengers were located within a radius.\n\nIt was reported that the terrain was not charted accurately, and that there were no warnings given to the crew. It was also reported that the aircraft struck a ridge during its approach to Runway 26 at Son Bonet Airport.\n\nThe captain of the flight had previous experience of landing at Son Bonet Airport. However, the accident aircraft had never been operated by Eirjet before, and the first officer had flown the route only twice. It was reported that the crew had no training in respect of instrument approaches.\n\nThe cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were sent to the AAIB, where they were analysed. The CVR was not damaged during the crash, and was intact when recovered. The FDR was undamaged during the recovery. Both units were sent to the AAIB in the United Kingdom for analysis.\n\nThe cockpit voice recorder contained 85 hours of data. The CVR recorded the last 30 minutes of the flight. The FDR contained over 25 hours of data, including a detailed data block showing the position of the aircraft over the preceding 24 hours.\n\nThe CVR was analysed by the AAIB in the United Kingdom. The cockpit crew spoke English, and the quality of the recording was found to be very good. A transcript of the recording was created, and a total of 27 minutes of the recording was selected for further analysis.\n\nThe analysis of the CVR showed that the aircraft was in a normal cruising configuration on the approach to Son Bonet Airport. It was reported that there was no evidence of any unusual aircraft movements or indications. The wind was reported to have been from the south-east at , and the runway at Son Bonet Airport was reported to have been dry at the time of the approach.\n\nDuring the approach to Son Bonet Airport the flight crew received a windshear warning, which they ignored. At this time the captain stated that"
