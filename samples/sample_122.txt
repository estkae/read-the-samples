Surging.\n\nI was a fan of Steppenwolf's Magic Carpet Ride when I was younger, and my tastes have not changed.\n\nI have been listening to Steppenwolf non-stop.\n\nBut this is not a tribute band, they are completely on their own turf.\n\nThere is a burning wildness in the vocals, an urgency in the songs, that you don't see in tribute bands.\n\nAnd the lead guitar is stellar. I don't even have to describe it because the sound is unmistakable, like the perfect mix of Carlos Santana and David Gilmour.\n\nThe group members hail from all over the planet: Stacey Blades is from New York City, Marco Panascia from Brazil, Marco Alfonso, of Caracas, Venezuela, and Juan Pablo Torres from Guayaquil, Ecuador.\n\nTheir bandcamp page gives you a good overview of their sound:\n\nhttps://steppenwolfband.bandcamp.com/
