"Kitakata Castle\n\nIt is located in the north-east corner of the town of Kitakata, in the middle of a busy commercial and residential district. There are over 100 buildings within the castle area, some of which date to the 16th century.\n\nThe current castle was built by Lord Takanashi Tadatoshi, a grandson of Tadamasa by his second son Tadatoshi, in 1593, when he moved from Edo. The castle was built to fend off the frequent attacks from the warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi, but after the castle fell into Hideyoshi's hands in 1597, he returned the castle to Tadatoshi in 1598. Tadatoshi ruled the area until his death in 1608, when his son Tadakatsu took over, and in 1615, Tadakatsu and his son Tadakiyo moved the domain to Yonezawa Domain in Dewa Province, taking many retainers and craftsmen with them.\n\nThe castle survived intact until the Meiji period, when the buildings were torn down to build a school, with the stone walls being sold as material for a new Shinto shrine. In 1945, an extensive excavation was carried out, but the process was not well documented.\n\nThe site was listed as a National Historic Site in 2001.\n\nThe castle remains were fully excavated between 1980 and 1984, and included 24 structures in total. Many were reassembled on site. The castle was a yagura-style four-story donjon, and is considered to be the earliest example of this style in Tohoku. Its area was 25,000 square meters, and it is estimated that its height was 31 meters.\n\nThe only structures from the castle to survive are the Gate of Peace, the Sword House, and a well. There is also a reconstruction of the Well of Grace. The gardens have also been restored, and there is a path around the castle with information on the structures.\n\n\n
