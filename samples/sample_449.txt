Transport and Communications Workers Union\n\nThe Transport and Communications Workers Union (T&CWU) is a trade union in Trinidad and Tobago, with the bulk of its membership employed by the state-owned National Petroleum Company (Petrotrin).\n\nThe union was founded in 1952 as the Oilfield Workers Trade Union, and in 1974 it became the Petroleum Workers Trade Union. In 1977, the union renamed itself as the National Oilfield Workers Trade Union, and then in 1987, the name was changed again to the National Oilfield Workers Union.\n\nThe union changed its name again in 1997 to its current form. In 2005, it merged with the Civil Service and Allied Workers Union, forming the Petroleum and Allied Workers Trade Union. The union re-split in 2007.\n\nFor many years, the union was led by Ancel Roget, and in 1997 he was convicted for soliciting a $40,000 bribe from an executive at the Shell Oil Company. In 2000, Roget was forced to retire from his position at Petrotrin due to a management investigation.\n\nIn 2006, the union was involved in a strike over the state of Petrotrin. In 2010, the union was accused of illegally striking.\n\nIn 2008, a branch of the T&CWU was reported to have hired gang members to threaten striking Petrotrin workers.\n\n\n
