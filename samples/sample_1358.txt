I am working with the Redhat linux 14.1 and VirtualBox . In Redhat when I boot up my virtual machine I get the message,( There is no access to keyboard, as a result unable to input password) so I am not able to get into the system. But in the same version of the Redhat I am able to get the password on the login screen. But I need to fix the problem and login with the keyboard. I have even tried to put the xhost +SI:localuser:root into the .xinitrc file and then it still wont work. Can someone please help me in this regard.\n\nNOTE: If I log into the virtual machine from the virtual box client, then I can see the login prompt and I am able to login with the keyboard, but I want to be able to login with the keyboard from the command line.
