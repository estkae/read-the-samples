Washington State: About a half-dozen coal-fired power plants are in various stages of planning or development on the shores of Puget Sound, prompting complaints that they would dramatically increase pollution in the region and conflict with the state’s plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has approved permits to the builders for two plants — one near Bellingham, Wash., the other near Longview, Wash. — after permitting changes were requested by Washington’s governor. Opponents have appealed the permits to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, and are asking that the permits be withdrawn.\n\nThe appeals “will demonstrate that the agency can no longer defend the approval of these dirty coal plants,” said Bill Arthur, a lawyer for environmental groups. The proposed plants “will generate thousands of tons of greenhouse gases every year, while killing thousands of people.”\n\nThe Department of Energy, which provided $7.1 billion to help coal-fired plants, would be a big winner if the coal plants are built, analysts said. The department has committed $1.65 billion in loan guarantees for the Longview plant and $3.5 billion for the plant near Bellingham.
