QUEBEC CITY—It is unclear whether the Trump administration’s plan to impose tariffs on imported cars and vehicle parts will apply to the new North American trade deal, and it is not something Canada will easily accept.\n\nThat is the takeaway from the close to 14 hours of talks on the sixth day of the trade dispute.\n\nA source with direct knowledge of the negotiations told The Canadian Press that it is not a certainty that the controversial Section 232 auto tariffs would be excluded from the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n\n“They’re trying to push this down our throats,” the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe USMCA was signed in late November, but only came into effect last month, while the 232 investigation into the auto sector has been underway since May 2018.\n\nUS Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has made it clear he’s interested in seeing how far he can push it, the source said.\n\nAfter meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in New York on Wednesday, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland sounded upbeat about the prospects of avoiding auto tariffs.\n\n“Our officials are working very hard right now to see if we can find a solution,” she said.\n\nFreeland and Lighthizer spoke by phone Thursday and both confirmed that work on the 232 issue would continue, she said.\n\n“There are a number of questions that are outstanding, including issues involving the auto sector, and we’re working hard to see if we can find a solution,” Freeland said.\n\n“We don’t want any surprises for our industries, either, so we’re continuing to work away at it, but as far as I can see right now, the relationship between the three countries is extremely positive and extremely constructive.”\n\nFreeland also said that officials are working on rules of origin that could apply to the new trade deal. She said she has had regular conversations with Lighthizer, Mexican Economy Secretary Ildefonso Guajardo and Jesus Seade, the chief NAFTA negotiator for incoming Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.\n\nMexico has warned it won’t ratify the new deal unless the auto tariffs are excluded.\n\nFreeland, for her part, did not sound optimistic about that prospect, saying it was an issue for the USTR.\n\n“This is something we’re going to be talking about over the course of the next little while,” she said.\n\nFreeland added that she has yet to meet with incoming Mexican foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard.\n\nThe USMCA is facing opposition from political forces on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nLast month, incoming Mexican president Lopez Obrador said he wouldn’t put his signature on the new deal until it is renegotiated. And in the U.S., Democrats have vowed to fight it, as have labour and environmental groups, both in Washington and in the provinces.\n\nFreeland made a quick visit to Washington to consult with congressional leaders. The result was a decision by Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and some other top Democrats not to sign off on a resolution ratifying the deal, at least not until the 232 auto tariffs are excluded.\n\nFreeland said Canada’s position has been well received by congressional leaders.\n\n“We’re going to continue to talk to U.S. Congress members and senators. I was on the Hill today, I was in both the Democratic and the Republican side, and I found that our position on 232 is widely understood and I found the conversations on the Hill to be positive.”\n\nMexico and Canada have also expressed their opposition to the 232 auto tariffs.\n\n“If it’s implemented, it would have significant impacts on the economy of the United States,” Mexican Economy Minister Graciela Marquez told a news conference in Mexico City.\n\n“For the region, it would generate a lot of uncertainty,” she added.\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue expressed disappointment with the Canadian position, saying Ottawa was obstructing progress.\n\n“I find it very disappointing, and if I were them, I’d be really anxious about their relationship with the United States,” Perdue said in a telephone interview from Colombia.\n\n“We’re not trying to disrupt the relationship. But you have to have a deal that’s a good deal.”\n\nPerdue added he was “extremely surprised” that the Canadian government was still resisting U.S. demands on the 232 issue.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, however, has praised the deal, and told Lighthizer on Tuesday that he wants him to negotiate it.\n\n“I look forward to working with you Bob on expediting the U.S.M.C.A. agreement to benefit our workers, farmers and manufacturers,” Trump wrote in a memo to Lighthizer that the USTR released Wednesday.\n\n“I have asked the Vice-President and the United States Trade Representative to continue negotiating with Canada on the terms of a possible agreement.”\n\nTrump is suggesting that his 232 probe is already settled, a position with which the Canadian source disputed.\n\n“That’s a pretty low bar,” the source said.\n\nThis story originally appeared on CBC
