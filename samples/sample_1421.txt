You should not use more than 3% in your product. This 3% is the lowest of all of those numbers.\n\n\n\nMaximum Product Base Guidelines:\n\n\n\nMP Soap: 3%\n\nCP, HP, CPOP Soap: 6%\n\nLotions and Scrubs: 1 – 2%\n\nBath Salts, Fizziest & Tub Soaks: 5-10%\n\nCandle Wax: 6-12% (see specific wax for exact levels)\n\n\n\nTo Determine The IFRA Guidelines:\n\n\n\nIFRA is a self-regulating trade organization that together with the industry's scientific center RIFM (the Research Institute for Fragrance Materials), establishes usage safety standards for materials that comprise fragrance and essential oils. Each year IFRA updates their standards based on sound science.\n\n\n\nWholesale Supplies Plus updates IFRA documents annually so that customers can stay up-to-date with the latest science. If you find IFRA levels have changed for your formula, it is standard to take 2 years to update products in the market. You can find Wholesale Supplies Plus IFRA documents on the “documents” tab of this product page.\n\n\n\nAdditional Information:\n\n\n\nFragrance oils that contain vanilla or vanillin will change color. The color change can take days, weeks, or months and can vary from a light ivory to dark brown. Our Crafter’s Choice Vanilla Color Stabilizers and Crafter’s Choice Vanilla Color Neutralizer will prevent some products from changing color. Oils that are dark in color, contain floral notes or spices may in time naturally change color.
