"Today I went to Paddington Markets for the first time!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was fantastic! Lots of stalls selling all sorts of food, clothes, trinkets etc. And we were there at the right time, as they were packing up for the night. So we were able to buy a whole bunch of food from various stalls, so we had dinner already planned for tomorrow night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, we couldn't really find anywhere to sit down and eat our food. There was lots of seating available, but everyone was waiting for friends, so there were no spare tables for us to have a sit down at. The result? Half our food ended up being eaten on the floor, as it was just so busy that we couldn't find anywhere else to sit. Not a huge problem, but I'd have preferred it if I could have had a proper sit down with the food.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, though, it was an awesome experience, and I'm excited for our next night out to the markets!
