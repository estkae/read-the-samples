[High Praise! to RT]\n\nJapan to develop android robots for Fukushima\n\n“Japan is looking to develop new robots to clean up the stricken Fukushima nuclear power plant. The process could take decades, experts say. The plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company, (TEPCO), is seeking funds to create machines that can withstand high radiation levels. “A robot that can work continuously is needed, as well as machines that can cut through the steel structures and repair damage,” a TEPCO spokesman told AFP.”\n\nGood thing we can make robots. Too bad we can’t make them that much faster!\n\n(Wait… did that make sense?)\n\n(HT: Wired)
