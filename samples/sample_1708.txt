"While both accounts are true, the explanations you have given are incomplete. The Washington Times, in an article entitled "3 million "dead voters"", puts the blame on the infamous book "Subversion of the United States Government", by Dr. Cleon Skousen. The book outlines the plan to subvert our government and outlines the three types of Communists, Cultural, Economic, and Military. This article also states that it is not only this book, but also three others: The Naked Communist, The Naked Capitalist, and The Naked Communist Goal for a World Government. These books were all written by Dr. Cleon Skousen. These four books are available at www.lrc-online.org/lrc-library/books.htm I highly recommend reading these books and analyzing the evidence. Another book you should read is How to be Free in a Police State. It is also written by Dr. Cleon Skousen and you can read it here: www.lrc-online.org/lrc-library/books.htm I have read all these books and the information presented is so alarming that it literally caused my hair to turn grey in only three weeks! The same applies to the people of my generation who have read this information. Please read these books, watch the videos at this site, and prepare to fight the good fight.
