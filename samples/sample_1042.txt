The loss came to Duke, a team the Tar Heels split the season series with.\n\nIn a 73-61 win over Providence in the Round of 64 on Friday, the Tar Heels were led by Marcus Paige, who scored 19 points with four assists. Brice Johnson also finished in double figures with 14 points and Kennedy Meeks and Isaiah Hicks added 12 points apiece.\n\nOn the season, Paige is the leading scorer at 15.5 points per game. Johnson is the team’s top rebounder at 9.4 per game and is second on the team in scoring at 12.6 ppg.\n\nBut on Saturday, the story on the stat sheet was second chance points. UNC won the battle of the offensive glass 16-5, which was a big reason why UNC held the Friars to just eight second half points. The Tar Heels also forced Providence into 18 turnovers and scored 22 points off those miscues.\n\n“You gotta give Providence credit because they did a great job,” said North Carolina coach Roy Williams after the game. “They gave us all we could handle and then"
