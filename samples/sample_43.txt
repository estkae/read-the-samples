A virtual machine is a simulated hardware that allows you to run other operating systems (or other versions of the same OS) at the same time as your current OS, inside a window on your current OS.

With a virtual machine, you can: Run another operating system (or another version of the same operating system) at the same time as your current operating system. Try out a new operating system without having to install it on your hard disk. Run applications for one operating system on another, without having to reboot your computer.\n\nStep 1: Create a New Virtual Machine\n\nVirtualBox provides a wizard that will assist you in creating a virtual machine.
