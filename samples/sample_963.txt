I purchased an Acer Aspire 5920 from Best Buy in New Jersey back in July 2009. The machine had 2.53 gig processor and 4 gig of RAM. I bought it specifically to run the 64 bit version of Windows 7 when it was available.\n\n\n\nI did upgrade the hard drive to a 1 TB drive at a later date and I replaced the wireless card. I did not upgrade the RAM.\n\n\n\nAfter about 8 months the machine started running slow and the sound stuttered at times. I went to Acer's site and found that there was an updated BIOS for my machine. I downloaded and installed the update.\n\n\n\nI went back to Acer's site a little later and found that there was also a BIOS update for the hard drive. This was great since I had already replaced the original hard drive with a larger 1 TB drive. The update also told me that I could do a "secure erase" of the drive.\n\n\n\nI downloaded and installed the update and then "secure erased" the drive. It worked great. The machine was running a lot faster and the sound wasn't stuttering anymore.\n\n\n\nI got back to Acer's site and found that there was also a BIOS update for the wireless card. I downloaded and installed that update too.\n\n\n\nAll was good for about another month. Then the machine started running slow again. I went back to Acer's site and discovered that there was yet another BIOS update for my machine.\n\n\n\nThis is when I got angry. I went back to the site of the original manufacturer of my laptop and the machine still showed that it had the original BIOS on it. I guess they didn't bother to update it.\n\n\n\nI went to the site of the original manufacturer and did a BIOS update on the machine myself. It worked fine for about a month.\n\n\n\nThen the machine started running slow again. I'm sure I could have done another BIOS update, but I didn't bother. Instead I bought a new machine.\n\n\n\nI have since learned that Acer never bothered to upgrade the BIOS on the machine. All the updates were done by other manufacturers. They are all now getting sued for not performing their duty of updating their BIOS and their failure to warn customers that the BIOS would not be updated and that it could cause their machines to run slow and/or have trouble with the wireless card.\n\n\n\nI have since been able to get $50 for the laptop from the landfill in my town. It still runs, but very slowly.\n\n\n\nI have also learned that some people think that just because a laptop has been "Secure Erased" that it has been "re-initialized" as if it were new. This is not the case. It only removes the file system and makes the drive ready to accept a new one.\n\n\n\nIt has been a month now and I have not been able to re-use the hard drive. My wife found a link to a site that could do a free scan of the hard drive and tell you if it has been re-initialized.\n\n\n\nWe were able to get the hard drive that we had in our old machine (after it died), and "Secure Erase" it. It's a smaller drive, but it works and it is better than nothing. We could also have done a data transfer from the old drive, but it would have been a huge pain to re-install all the programs we use.\n\n\n\nIt is a lot of work to deal with a laptop that you cannot re-use.\n\n\n\nDon't ever do a "Secure Erase" of your laptop drive unless you are able to test it and make sure that it has actually been "re-initialized".\n\n\n\nWe are now buying laptops from Hewlett Packard.
