The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Opioid Initiative, launched in 2015, is now widely seen as a turning point for the US government's response to the opioid crisis.\n\nIts very name represents a sea change in how the federal government views and treats the crisis, and its leadership role in the national response has shown that it takes opioid addiction seriously.\n\nBut experts say that CDC, along with state governments, still face challenges in reducing opioid overdose deaths.\n\nDr. Gail D'Onofrio, the chief of the Division of Emergency Medicine at Yale School of Medicine, said the key focus for the CDC now should be to give states support and the tools they need to develop local plans and initiatives.\n\n"I don't think the CDC should do it all," D'Onofrio said. "They can't."\n\nAmerica's opioid epidemic is largely a state and local crisis. State and local agencies, not the CDC, are responsible for drug-treatment programs, policing, and other areas of opioid response. And when it comes to administering Medicaid, states also have the lead role.\n\nFor this reason, CDC's success hinges on the agencies it funds, especially state health departments.\n\nHere's a look at the biggest obstacles to reducing opioid overdose deaths, and how CDC can address them.\n\nStates can't take on the opioid epidemic alone\n\nAmerica has a crisis on its hands. Opioid overdoses killed more than 42,000 people in 2016, and a July report from the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis noted that overdose deaths are "expected to keep rising."\n\n"We have to figure out a way to prevent the unintended consequences of our good intentions," said D'Onofrio.\n\nIn other words, the public-health responses to the opioid epidemic, from addiction treatment to education campaigns, are having a variety of unintended consequences.\n\nTo address them, experts say the CDC needs to support the state and local agencies, such as health departments and medical schools, that will be at the front lines of the response.\n\n"CDC has a responsibility to provide resources and expertise to state and local health departments," said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).\n\nVolkow said the agency should focus on supporting states with developing evidence-based strategies for reducing opioid overdoses, expanding treatment, and improving pain management.\n\n"We know that there are tools out there," she said. "But it takes the CDC and NIDA working together to identify them, develop them, and help distribute them."\n\nIt's not just about access to treatment\n\nIn the midst of the worst drug crisis in US history, it's easy to believe that all the country needs is more treatment to curb opioid addiction.\n\nBut experts say it's not just about access to treatment.\n\n"The CDC has to provide help to states and communities in building up their capacity to respond to this epidemic," said Dr. Jon Zibbell, chief of the Bureau of Epidemiology at the Pennsylvania Department of Health.\n\nTo do that, Zibbell said the agency needs to create a national, standardized system to track the crisis â€” including the spread of heroin, fentanyl, and prescription drugs.\n\nCDC also needs to provide guidelines for evidence-based treatments, Zibbell said, and train a workforce to deliver them.\n\nZibbell said that the opioid crisis is different from previous drug epidemics, like HIV and hepatitis, because it is widespread, affecting every age group and gender. And unlike previous drug epidemics, it is not driven by a specific drug like cocaine or crack, but by the opioid class of drugs.\n\nSo, unlike other drug crises, Zibbell said, the opioid epidemic is not tied to any particular place or population, or the supply of a certain drug.\n\nAnd because the crisis has been going on for so long, the country needs CDC support to build up local expertise and respond.\n\n"There's no way around it," Zibbell said. "The best thing for CDC to do is support local, state, and territorial health departments."\n\nFocusing on the health of the general public is also important\n\nThe opioid epidemic has put a spotlight on the harm opioids do to people who use them. But D'Onofrio says it's also important to remember that these drugs"
