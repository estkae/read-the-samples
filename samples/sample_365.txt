“Dark” will be the third in a series of single-pitch sport routes at Boulder Zephyr in Georgetown, Ontario. The sport crag is located a few kilometres west of Blue Mountain, Ontario. Here are the proposed grades and estimated lengths of the routes, which are currently being developed:\n\nDark (5.12a) — 35m\n\nMorning Light (5.11c) — 35m\n\nDawn Patrol (5.11b) — 35m\n\nLunch Break (5.10b) — 35m\n\nVibes (5.10a) — 35m\n\nThough none of these routes are bolted yet, and they are still only in the development stage, Boulder Zephyr is already a great place to go bouldering!\n\nSource: Peter Croft (Bouldering Ontario)
