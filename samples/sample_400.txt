The body piece is way too long for a normal sized girl, there’s so much extra material, you can barely make it look like the girl in the picture. It doesn’t look as cute as the other girls ones, and the extra length isn’t easy to shorten, because of the netting on the bottom.\n\nFun! Love this costume! My daughter is small and the medium was perfect! Can’t wait to see her in it at school on Halloween!\n\nBeautiful! This costume is beautiful! It fits true to size and looks great!\n\nGorgeous costume I love this costume and it fits true to size. I have a slender 7 year old, ordered the size 6-8, and it fits well with some room to grow into. The only drawback I see is the flippers are sewn into the gloves so she won’t be able to wear them separately, but that’s a small sacrifice for the beauty of this costume!\n\nCutest! Love it! My 5 yr old loves her new swimmer costume. It's made well, super cute and just the right amount of "bling"!\n\nSO STINKING CUTE! This costume is exactly what I was looking for! It’s super cute and fits well. My daughter is a 4t and I got her a 5-6 and it fits great! It’s also not super thin. It’s very well made!\n\nWonderful costume! Beautiful!

The colors are vibrant and fun, the quality is fantastic and the fit is perfect!\n\nSo pretty I bought this for my 4 year old daughter and she loves it! She is tiny so I ordered her a 4-6 which fit perfectly. It's well made and super pretty. Can't wait to see her wear it for Halloween\n\nadorable It is very pretty. The top is pretty sturdy. The bottom is light. It fits my 4 year old perfectly. My daughter is little and will not fit for very long. I love it!\n\nsuper cute This costume is so cute! I ordered the size 4-6 for my daughter who wears a size 4 in girl clothes and it fit perfectly. The material on the body piece is thick and the arms and feet are easy to get on and off, without being too loose.\n\nVery pretty I am very pleased with this costume. The colors are so vibrant and the quality is good. The size fits perfect.
