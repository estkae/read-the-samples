Will the traditional establishment defend democracy?\n\nBy Alexandra Morton\n\nUBC-O Sea Around Us Project\n\nI am scared to my bones. For the first time in my life I am terrified that what I learned as a child is wrong. There is no more mother or father to turn to. There is no more food to count on. This is my last chance to sound the alarm that we are being systematically robbed and cheated and lied to and I don’t know what we are going to do about it.\n\nA few years ago I could not have imagined that I would find myself writing this. I was born and raised in the village of Old Massett on Haida Gwaii, also known as the Queen Charlotte Islands, in Canada. We fish and hunt and gather food and make our own shelter and build our own community. This is how it has been for thousands of years. In modern language this is called subsistence living. We were the last people in Canada to sign treaties with our colonial oppressors in the 1800s. These documents were the foundation of our way of life.\n\nThen it all changed in the early 2000s when the first commercial aquaculture license was issued on our coasts. At first, like most people on Haida Gwaii, I thought that farming fish would provide income for our community. Little did I know that the promise of wealth would come with a heavy price.\n\nThe first evidence I saw that something was wrong was in 2006. The sea lice were everywhere and a fish farm had started using a pesticide called Slice. I saw the sea lice on the fish and sea lions. I saw sea lions coughing up blood, the bones on their backs visible through their skin.\n\nIn 2007, the open net pen at salmon farm salmon feedlots one kilometre off the coast of my village collapsed. An estimated two to three million Atlantic salmon, with a value of $6.5 million to $8 million, swam into the ocean. There was no monitoring, no analysis of the risk to wild salmon, not a word to local communities.\n\nAnd then the toxins appeared. In 2008 and 2009 people in my village became sick and died. In the village of Klemtu next door, children were born with flipper-like hands and feet. In Norway, which had a higher concentration of fish farms, brain tumours and other cancers were rising and women were giving birth to deformed babies.\n\nI looked at these stories and thought, “This can’t happen to us.”\n\nThis was followed by the closure of the Haida Nation’s only grocery store. People in my village and community started suffering from serious health problems, especially neurological ones. We were told it was due to influenza or SARS. We had no idea that a toxin, which our bodies have not evolved to handle, was being released into the air and our water. The Sea Around Us reported that fish farms were creating the most toxic area in the world, right next to the First Nations in Haida Gwaii. This happened, and no one told us.\n\nI realized I had to do something. For the first time in my life I realized that what my ancestors had always taught me was wrong. It was not nature that took care of us. It was we who were responsible for taking care of nature.\n\nI wrote my first letter to the local newspaper. It was my story, and I was afraid to publish it.\n\n“How many people have to get sick and die before they take this seriously?” I asked.\n\nWe waited and waited, and nothing happened. I wrote my second letter. Nothing.\n\nWe waited and waited. Still nothing.\n\nPeople in my village got sick and died, and the Norwegian scientists kept warning that their food supply was being contaminated. We were told that this was the price of progress, that it was our job to clean up the mess. And we had to do it on our own.\n\nAnd then the baby seals came. There are no young sea lions, so the seals started eating the herring. At first we thought it was cute. Then we realized they were killing the herring. There were too many seals.\n\nI wrote my third letter. I looked at the numbers and saw that Norway was killing 80,000 seals a year and there were only 80,000 seals left.\n\nI started to organize rallies and a campaign called Save the Herring, which caught the attention of major news outlets across the globe. By this time I had a voice. I was a professor of biology at UBC and one of the world’s experts on fish farming, open net pen fish farms, and marine pollution. I knew the science.\n\n“How many baby seals have to get cancer before they take this seriously?” I asked.\n\nIn the midst of this, Canada approved a massive new open net pen farm. This was the largest salmon farm in the world. Our local paper warned us that “the massive farm will increase marine pollution in the area.” This farm started dumping blood and feces into our waters. The evidence was mounting that we were at risk of a catastrophic collapse in our food web.\n\nBut no one cared. The aquaculture industry is worth $400 million a year. We can’t compete with that.\n\nA new form of ocean zoning called an impact assessment was supposed to keep salmon farms out of sensitive areas, but it was all a lie. The people who wrote it are in the industry. They gave themselves exemptions.\n\nThen I realized that I could make a living as a scientist. So I created a lab at the University of Victoria to study the toxins from fish farms. We started to find the pollutants in the mussels and the herring. I published more and more scientific papers.\n\nWe held more rallies, and I wrote more and more letters to the local paper. We were ignored and dismissed.\n\nSo we went to the Supreme Court. Our case was thrown out, but the judge was extremely critical of the Canadian government and gave them 18 months to fix their laws. But the government is now granting the aquaculture industry a blanket exemption from environmental laws and protections. The judge told them that they could not do this. But they did.\n\nI have studied toxicology for 30 years and I have never seen this. We know that these toxins are not getting into our environment accidentally. The only reason they are there is because someone put them there. It is like they are trying to poison us.\n\nAnd then we started to see a new toxin. This time it was a by-product of the feed used in the salmon pens.\n\nA Norwegian scientist tested a by-product of salmon feed. The test showed that it was toxic. The Norwegian government stopped using the feed. In 2015, that same scientist tested all the salmon feed used in the British Columbia industry. The results showed that there was another new toxin, this time a carcinogen. The Norwegian scientist said, “It is extremely unlikely that it could happen at such high levels by chance.”\n\n“How many toxins have to get into our food before we take this seriously?” I asked.\n\nThis time I knew that there was something wrong with my brain. We found out that Norway and Scotland were using the same feed. We had a toxic lab here in British Columbia, so what about Norway and Scotland? And the feed is approved by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and used in these salmon farms.\n\nIt’s hard to see who we are going to turn to.\n\nThen a woman in Ketch Harbour started asking questions. She wrote to the local paper and was ridiculed and insulted. She wrote to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. He never replied.\n\nShe was not from my village. She was a white woman from Newfoundland. Her grandfather was a fisherman.\n\nI wrote to her, and then I realized I could write to everyone. And I did. I started to get hundreds of people to write letters, and we wrote to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and to our Premier, the head of our government. We wrote to every MLA, the Members of the Legislative Assembly, and we were ignored and dismissed.\n\nSo we went to court again. This time we were supported by 30 affidavits from fishermen and local citizens.\n\nI went to the hearings. The minister did not even show up. His lawyer said that we should stop questioning him and just accept that he is doing the right thing. He had no explanation as to why the 30 affidavits were not enough evidence to put a stop to this industrial salmon farming.\n\n“If I had a million dollars, I could save Haida Gwaii,” I said.\n\nBut I have never been able to raise that money. The man who tried to stop me is now running for Premier, and he is the frontrunner.\n\nSo I wrote my fifth letter to the editor. I warned that if we continued to use this feed, we would all get sick and die.\n\nAnd then I realized that I could put this on Facebook.\n\nA few months ago, the BC government ordered the feed company to remove this toxin from their products. But they still sell it in other provinces. There is still no ban on the feed, even though Norway has banned it, the FDA has banned it, and Health Canada has banned it.\n\nAnd then I realized I could just get on a bus and go to Toronto and speak to people directly.\n\nSo that is what I am doing. I am going to make this my life’s work. I am going to stand in front of people, in universities, in public hearings, and tell them my story. I am going to explain that it is not
