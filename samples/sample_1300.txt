Maxime de la Falaise\n\nMaxime de la Falaise (née Ray; May 2, 1909 – January 17, 2002) was an American fashion designer and muse to Christian Dior. She is best known for being the inspiration for the "New Look" (after the 1949 collection which she wore to great acclaim).\n\nDe la Falaise was born as Maxime Ray to a wealthy American family. She was the daughter of Florence, a well-known portrait artist, and DeWitt Ray, a mining tycoon. De la Falaise, who grew up in Europe, moved to the United States during World War II, where she met and married American lawyer, writer, and politician Stewart Woodford "Woody" Brickell, who was the first man to run for governor of New York state on the Liberal ticket in 1938. The couple adopted two children, Andy and Daphne. De la Falaise met Dior through friends, and she quickly became his muse. In the early 1940s, de la Falaise convinced Dior to hire John Galliano, and later in the 1950s, she suggested that Dior hire Yves Saint Laurent.\n\nDuring her time as Dior's muse, de la Falaise was photographed by both Cecil Beaton and Horst P. Horst. Horst captured her in images for "Vogue" and "Harper's Bazaar", as well as the cover for Dior's "New Look" in 1947. The New Look was an evolution in women's fashion that took place in the 1940s and helped to rebuild Parisian couture after World War II. It was a slimmer, longer silhouette, and one of the dresses, called "Corolle", is famous for having influenced the style of Marilyn Monroe. De la Falaise is often credited with inspiring the New Look, and the dress from the collection is now housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In addition to Dior's fashion house, de la Falaise also influenced the style of Christian Dior S.A. It was said that she made a subtle, but important contribution to the Dior brand.\n\nDe la Falaise died in New York City on January 17, 2002, at the age of 92.\n\n
