Almost three years after the Olympic flame was extinguished in Rio de Janeiro, it has emerged that one of the hosts of the Games made a complaint against the organisers for his portrayal in a promotional video.\n\nThe BBC has obtained a letter written by Tancredo Neves, the president of Brazil from 1985-1990, in which he bemoans the way in which he was depicted alongside other former heads of state in a short film for the Rio 2016 Games.\n\nNeves was seen sitting in the back of a car with his fellow presidents — George W Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama — travelling to a summit in Rio de Janeiro to discuss the response to global warming.\n\nHe also features in a press conference with the other three leaders at the conference and appears alone at the Rio Earth Summit, walking across the floor and shaking hands with the then-United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan.
