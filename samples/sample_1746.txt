Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 (officially abbreviated THPS5) is a skateboarding video game developed by Robomodo and published by Activision. It was announced on May 12, 2014, as the first game in the Tony Hawk's series since 2012's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD, and was released on September 29, 2015, for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with a Microsoft Windows release on October 30, 2015. The game features a similar style of gameplay from previous Tony Hawk games, as well as supporting both online multiplayer and local split screen.\n\nGameplay [ edit ]\n\nTony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 was originally set to follow a heavily story-driven approach similar to its predecessors, featuring a sandbox-type open world environment.[4][5] However, the game underwent several changes during development and was panned by critics and fans alike upon release due to gameplay issues, with the sandbox style levels being omitted entirely.[6]\n\nTony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 is primarily a skating video game, similar to the previous games in the series. The game is a sandbox-style game, in which players are free to skate around levels with various missions to complete. There are a number of gameplay modes in the game, including single player, online multiplayer, and local multiplayer.[7]\n\nThe game features nine worlds and forty levels.[8] Unlike previous Tony Hawk games, it does not include a story mode. Instead, the game's story is told through cutscenes, between levels.[9] In a similar fashion to previous entries in the series, players are able to complete missions in levels to progress through the game. New to the series are Combo Quests. Completing these will result in a special Combo Meter being activated, with rewards being awarded for a high combo score.[10] The game also allows players to access most levels in any order.[11]\n\nControls in the game have been modified from earlier entries in the series.[12] The left and right sticks are used to perform basic tricks, while the right trigger is used for manual (revert) and the left trigger for special, a new type of move that allows players to perform aerial tricks with more precision.[13] The left and right triggers are also used to ollie, depending on whether the player is using the left or right stick.[12] A control scheme called "Simple controls" has also been introduced, which allows players to perform tricks using a single button, simplifying the gameplay.[14]\n\nDevelopment and release [ edit ]\n\nOn May 12, 2014, Activision confirmed that a new entry in the Tony Hawk's series was in development, the first since 2012's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD.[15] A teaser trailer was released later that month, showing gameplay footage from the new game, along with confirmation that Robomodo was developing the title.[16] In July 2014, Activision confirmed that the game would also be released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms,[17] with the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions being announced soon after.[18]\n\nIt was revealed that the game was set to use a "brand new graphics engine",[19] though later reports suggested that it would instead be using an engine previously used in the mobile game Tony Hawk's Shred Session, developed by Canada-based developer Toys for Bob.[20][21] Activision initially refused to reveal what developer was working on the game,[22] though the developer was later revealed to be Robomodo, who previously developed 2012's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD.[23][24] The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game were cancelled in January 2015, with no plans to release those versions.[25] The PC version was released in October 2015.[26]\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nTony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 was met with negative reviews. It holds an aggregate score of 27 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 55 reviews,[1] and a 33% approval rating on GameRankings, based on 34 reviews.[2] Many critics cited the lack of game modes and poor quality graphics as the main reasons for the game's low score.["
