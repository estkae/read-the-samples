Barcelona will take on Juventus in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final tie on Tuesday, as the La Liga champions look to make it back-to-back European trophies.\n\nBarcelona\n\nForm: FC Barcelona have had a mixed season in La Liga, sitting in third place in the table, 15 points behind leaders Atletico Madrid, and a point off second-placed Valencia.\n\nHowever, they still have the chance to win their seventh La Liga title in eight years and are in the Copa del Rey final against Athletic Bilbao. The Catalans have been victorious in nine of their 11 European matches this season, but were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Atletico.\n\nKey player: It will take an outstanding performance from one of the stars of the Catalan club for them to overcome the Italian side. Lionel Messi is coming off his second Golden Shoe award in three years and has 18 league goals so far this campaign, the same number as Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nJuventus\n\nForm: Juventus are currently sitting top of Serie A, just two points ahead of Napoli with three games left. They have gone 29 matches without a defeat in the league this season, a run that stretches back to October.\n\nThe Old Lady have been eliminated from the Coppa Italia by AC Milan but are in the semi-finals of the Europa League against Benfica. Juventus beat Bayern Munich in the last 16 of the Champions League to make the last eight and are in their first Champions League quarter-final since 2006.\n\nKey player: Arturo Vidal, Alvaro Morata and Carlos Tevez all offer Juventus attacking prowess, but if they are to get past Barcelona, it will be thanks to the defensive work of Andrea Pirlo.\n\nThe veteran midfielder has been key in Juveâ€™s run to the quarter-finals, and while he may not score the goals, his organisation of the team will be vital in the coming weeks.\n\nRecent form\n\nBarcelona: DWWWWWWWW\n\nJuventus: WWWWWWW\n\nPossible lineups\n\nBarcelona: Valdes; Alves, Pique, Mascherano, Adriano; Xavi, Busquets, Iniesta; Neymar, Messi, Sanchez\n\nJuventus: Buffon; Barzagli, Bonucci, Chiellini; Lichtsteiner, Pirlo, Vidal, Pogba, Marchisio; Tevez, Morata\n\nSports Mole says: 1-1 (5-4 on aggregate)
