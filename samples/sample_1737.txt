The suspects - accused of setting ablaze nearly 30 houses belonging to Christians in Upper Egypt's Minya - reportedly pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group.\n\nTwo men suspected of carrying out an arson attack that left dozens of Christian homes in ruins in Egypt's Minya have reportedly pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL).\n\n"The main perpetrator of the attack in the village of Kom al-Loufy said he is a member of the Islamic State group, while the other suspect said he pledged allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi," state-run Ahram Online reports, citing Egyptian security sources.\n\nThe attack on Kom al-Loufy, a village approximately 40 miles south of the city of Minya, took place on June 30, Egypt's Coptic Orthodox church, which is headquartered in the city, said in a statement on July 1.\n\nIn the attack, at least 29 homes, three cars, and three businesses were burned, in addition to "a local Coptic Orthodox church and the village's shared religious building," the church noted.\n\nAccording to Ahram Online, the suspects - who have yet to be identified - are both in police custody.\n\n"They have been referred to the general prosecution in the nearby city of Minya on charges of burning houses and inciting sectarian strife," the state-run outlet continues.\n\nCoptic Christian homes in Minya, located approximately 200 miles south of Cairo, have been targeted in several arson attacks in recent months.\n\nOne of the most high-profile incidents involved a December attack that left two Coptic Christian families homeless and three individuals dead.\n\nISIS-affiliated militants have launched several deadly attacks on Christians in Egypt, such as the beheading of dozens of Christians in separate incidents in December and January.\n\nAttacks on Christians have grown worse since the military ouster of the Muslim Brotherhood's Muhammad Morsi in 2013.\n\nIn the wake of the ouster, Christians have been repeatedly targeted by radical Islamists.\n\nSome of the attacks include the beheading of a group of Coptic Christians on a beach in Libya and the killing of an elderly Christian couple in northern Sinai.\n\nBack in March, Christians were targeted in simultaneous bombings in two churches in Egypt that killed nearly 50 people.\n\nOne of the two attackers arrested claimed allegiance to ISIS.\n\nMeanwhile, a military offensive in Egypt's Sinai that began last month is targeting the ISIS-affiliated Wilayat Sinai terrorist group.\n\nThe offensive is part of a larger counterterrorism operation in Sinai that has also been targeted at al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorists.
