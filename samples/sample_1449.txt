"One thing that you notice right away about AdoramaPix is that their site is well organized and there are tons of categories and tags that make it easy to find what you want. Once you pick a category you are presented with more options to narrow your search, which means you can pick your specific camera (even if it is only a point and shoot or a particular make and model), the style of your photos, and a budget. Once you narrow your choices, you are presented with more options, such as the type of subjects you want to photograph. Once you are done with that, you can choose how many photos you want (from 2 to 5) and whether you want them on a USB key (the standard) or a CD (in case you want to print them yourself). You can also customize the entire project from start to finish.
