Re: TBZ probably wont get removed. i havent seen any signs of it being removed and its quite common, also as said its very different to speed.\n\n\n\nim not saying im not against the substance, i just know it well and wouldnt want it removed without knowing all the facts and how much of it is used.\n\nIts the same with alot of drugs like cannabis for example which is in the class A category but there are people who smoke it on a regular basis without it effecting there life, just as TBZ seems to have no major ill effects on users.\n\n\n\nOn a side note i once knew a very nice man who was in his late 50's who told me that when he was young and had alot of cash he used to drink a bottle of whisky a day and he was fine, he seemed to be really quite bright and loved his family. He had worked his way up to a senior position in the government and was quite a nice guy, not a pleasant drunk but not a nasty one either.\n\n\n\nAlso when i worked in care homes we had alot of residents who had alchol issues, some would stay sober for months at a time and others would drink all day everyday. The ones that drank everyday had some of the lowest scores on the rissmann scale (which is for mental health) so if it effects mental health does that mean these guys were not mentally healthy because they drank every day? its quite easy to argue both sides and i know that some drugs can be very bad for you, just as some can be fine if used in moderation. I havent seen any facts to support it being removed yet.\n\n\n\nOne thing i do know is that there are far worse things on the streets than TBZ and im sure the government wont waste resources trying to control that which they think is no worse than TBZ
