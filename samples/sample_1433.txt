Two of the biggest stories in the world of esports today are one: the ongoing lawsuit between Riot Games and Magic: The Gathering creator Wizards of the Coast over intellectual property; and two: the issues surrounding the current state of Counter-Strike’s competitive scene and the controversy that has come with it.\n\nFor now, let’s focus on that first one: the lawsuit. Back in March, Riot filed a lawsuit against Wizards of the Coast in a California district court, alleging that “Wizards has wrongfully filed and maintained two trademark applications on the word ‘DOTA’” and has sought to “block Riot from using the mark ‘DOTA,’ which has been in use by Riot for nearly eight years,” according to the statement.\n\nFor those not following the case too closely, Riot claimed that Wizards has used “threats of litigation” to prevent them from using the term “DOTA”. In an interview with the esports and culture media outlet The Score, Riot president Marc Merrill confirmed that, “Yes, that is what happened. I don’t think it’s ever a good thing to be threatened by anyone with litigation. I think that if you have to go to court, that’s what courts are for.”\n\nThe court’s response to Riot’s allegations? “Magic: The Gathering, the popular card game that started it all, was released in 1993, the same year as the video game Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, from Blizzard Entertainment. The Warcraft video game was licensed from the card game, which is one of the main reasons for Magic: The Gathering’s original name. And while the games differ, Blizzard has acknowledged that the character Arthas, from the Warcraft series, was named after the character Arthas Menethil from the card game.”\n\nAfter that, the response explained how Wizards has used the term “DOTA” for years, “including ‘DOTA’s’ use as a registered mark for, among other things, trading cards, game software, and entertainment services. ‘DOTA’s’ registration for the trading card game expired in 2011. But that registration was not the first, as Riot has argued. Rather, it was the seventh registration that ‘DOTA’ has received from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. ‘DOTA’ has been a registered mark of Wizards for over thirteen years.”\n\nRiot tried to assert that Riot had “acquired” “DOTA” by incorporating the term into their “League of Legends” game, and that Riot had the right to use the term. The court disagreed, and instead found that Riot was actually the one infringing on Wizards’s trademark, writing that, “The District Court noted that ‘DOTA’ was coined and first used by [Riot’s predecessor] Blizzard to describe a class of computer games, that Riot ‘was aware of [that use] at least as early as 2008,’ and that ‘at some point after 2008, Riot Games deliberately changed the [League of Legends] mode name from “Defense of the Ancients” to “DOTA.’”\n\nThis ruling is important because, as the lawsuit shows, Riot has knowingly and willfully used a trademark that belongs to someone else. If Riot is found guilty of the charges, they could face financial damages as well as a prohibition from using the term “DOTA” in any capacity. As the court ruling read, “Riot will not be allowed to ‘use’ DOTA as a trademark in connection with its products and services, including use in connection with its League of Legends game and merchandise.”\n\nThe response also explained that, “Riot Games’s misuse of Wizards’s ‘DOTA’ trademark is a clear attempt to confuse consumers into believing that ‘DOTA’ refers to Riot Games’s products. This is accomplished by using the name ‘DOTA’ as an acronym for the video game League of Legends, even though ‘DOTA’ is the name of a specific computer game mode in Warcraft III and its derivatives, and not a generic term for ‘Defense of the Ancients.’”\n\nThe court ruling also notes that, “The issue is not whether the ‘DOTA’ computer game mode or name is better or more popular than Riot Games’s League of Legends. Rather, the issue is whether Riot’s infringement of Wizards’s trademark was willful and malicious, thereby justifying an award of exemplary damages under California law.”\n\nRiot could still potentially win the lawsuit, and as Merrill stated in The Score interview, “We want people to know we’re serious about [the lawsuit].” However, the court’s ruling is looking more and more favorable to Wizards, and a future ruling from the court will probably result in Riot having to pay compensation to Wizards of the Coast for their infringement on Wizards’s trademark.\n\nThe second part of this story, however, is a bit different.\n\nAt the beginning of March, the esports tournament organizer FACEIT announced that the Esports Championship Series (ECS) would be moving to a franchising model. Afterward, TEO reached out to a number of people in the Counter-Strike community to get their thoughts on the change, including Richard Lewis, owner of the esports news outlet Richard Lewis Online, and Duncan “Thorin” Shields, professional esports journalist. The problem was that this was all announced on the same day that the two parties, Lewis and Shields, announced that they would be parting ways with their respective outlets, as well as taking time off of social media. This was particularly notable because Lewis and Shields had a working relationship for over a decade.\n\nThe day after the announcement, Lewis explained in a series of tweets that the split had been amicable and that, while the future of his site was uncertain, he was not stepping away from esports journalism. As of now, Lewis has returned to social media and his site is running, while Shields is still on hiatus.\n\nHowever, according to a report from Dot Esports, “When [FACEIT] announced its plans, it did so without consulting its partner teams.” The article went on to explain that, while FACEIT had claimed that the new model would increase revenue to the teams participating, and thus increase the amount of money that could be paid to players, “none of the teams TEO contacted agreed with the potential benefits of such a move.”\n\nThe article also explained that, “When a representative from one of the top teams reached out to Lewis for help in understanding the situation, the industry veteran encouraged them to join his team in voting against the move. According to Lewis, his response was that"
