While we were all distracted by the theatrics of the right-wing response to the healthcare reform bill, the Senate was engaged in a coup d'état against the American people. The main stream media have managed to keep the story out of the headlines, but it is of critical importance.\n\nEarlier this year, the House passed the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (HR542) which provided that:\n\n"a new medicine cannot receive FDA approval or be lawfully marketed in the United States unless the sponsor has submitted to the Secretary [of Health and Human Services] any clinical trial information that was in the sponsor's possession on the date of enactment of this Act and the Secretary has received such information before the date on which the sponsor submitted the new medicine application."\n\nThe language was an attempt to codify the protection for "secret science" that the tobacco industry got from the federal courts. It was an attempt to hide clinical trial data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that manufacturers did not want the public or the agency to see. It was an attempt to require that drug manufacturers be forced to put the public health at risk in order to prevent disclosure of their secret, but flawed, clinical trial data.\n\nIt was an attempt to get around the plain language of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) of 1992. In PDUFA, Congress required the submission of all clinical trial data and records to the FDA as a precondition for marketing approval of new drugs and biologics. As Senator Pat Leahy put it at the time:\n\n"In the past, the FDA had to request the data, then manufacturers would often refuse to comply, and there was no mechanism in the law to force them to provide the information. PDUFA corrects this. PDUFA requires manufacturers to provide the information upon request."\n\nThe House bill provided that FDA could not review or rely upon any data submitted after enactment of the law. It was a very carefully written attempt to prevent the FDA from relying upon data in determining whether a drug should be marketed.\n\nThe House and Senate worked out a compromise version of the bill that was finally passed by both houses and signed into law by President Obama on September 27, 2012. The House passed the compromise version with an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 396 to 14. The Senate passed the bill by unanimous consent.\n\nAs part of the compromise, a few words were changed.\n\n"The sponsor shall submit to the Secretary [of Health and Human Services] any clinical trial information described in clause (i) that was in the sponsor's possession on the date of enactment of this Act, and the Secretary shall receive such information before the date on which the sponsor submits the application."\n\nThose few words mean everything.\n\nThey mean that any information in the possession of a drug manufacturer on the date of enactment of the law in September of 2012, must be submitted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services by the date on which the sponsor submits the application. The sponsor does not have to wait for the FDA to ask for it. The FDA cannot "compel" its submission. The FDA cannot take any action to ensure the data is submitted. It is not provided that the FDA cannot "consider" the data. It is simply not in the statute.\n\nSince the FDA does not have access to the data, it cannot make a decision on the safety and efficacy of a new drug.\n\nThat means that under this statute, a drug manufacturer can market a new drug without any evidence that the drug is safe and effective.\n\nThat means that the few drugs that are tested must be tested on the American people with absolutely no evidence of safety or efficacy.\n\nThat means that when the FDA is forced to rely upon the manufacturers' representations of the safety and efficacy of their drugs, it must violate its statutory duty to protect the public health.\n\nThat means that no matter how many people die from using the drugs, no matter how many lives are ruined by their use, no matter how many of us become addicted to the drugs, the manufacturers cannot be held accountable for selling a defective product.\n\nThat means that when we allow a manufacturer to market a drug without safety and efficacy evidence, we are engaging in medical malpractice.\n\nThat means that the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) of 2012 is the most dangerous piece of legislation that has ever been passed by Congress.\n\nThis is no small thing.\n\nIt is tantamount to a coup d'état against the American people.\n\nIt was the most carefully crafted statute that Congress had ever enacted. The language was not included in the final version of the statute without the most careful and deliberate reflection by both houses of Congress. It was not a matter of oversight. It was not a drafting mistake. It was a deliberate decision by both houses of Congress.\n\nCongress has the power to change the law. As I write this, the Senate is in session. It can go into session on September 8, 2013 to change the law. If the Senate does not act, it will be complicit in the deaths that will occur.\n\nI understand that the Senate will not likely go into session until after the November election. I understand that it will take some time to write a new bill, and then for the President to sign it into law. I understand that there are many problems that Congress needs to deal with, and that healthcare reform is at the top of the list.\n\nBut I know that unless Congress acts, thousands of Americans will die over the next two years as a result of taking drugs that are not safe and effective.\n\nThere is no excuse for not acting to prevent those deaths.\n\nIt is inconceivable that this Congress could stand by while thousands of Americans die. It is unforgivable that Congress could pass legislation that would put the public health at such risk.\n\nIn January of 2009, President Obama said:\n\n"The days of giving the American people shoddy service or selling them substandard products or even putting their safety at risk in the name of profit are over. "\n\nCongress' most recent actions go against every promise that the President made.\n\nThere are currently thousands of people who are dying from taking a drug that was not safe and effective.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012"
