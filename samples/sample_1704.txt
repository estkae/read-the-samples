Thats the design to do, that not everybody does it. But after 2 years working on many different projects I know that this works better and it saves time. It makes your job much more easy. The good thing about working with it is that you can export directly from Sketch, just export layers and you're done, you can already use that file in the software you want to use.\n\nBut if you don't have to export every file from Sketch then I think you have to use it because it's easier and faster.\n\nAlso, I find it useful to group every design with its elements, it's the best way to manage a project.
