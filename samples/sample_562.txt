"The RSPCA is asking members of the public to be extra vigilant after a dog was shot in Bideford this week.\n\nThe injured animal was found on Friday, July 18.\n\nThe charity is working with the police in trying to trace the person responsible and is reminding the public to keep a look out for other animals, including wildlife, which could be in distress.\n\nBideford police station has been alerted to the incident and have confirmed that they have launched an investigation.\n\nThe dog, an adult German Shepherd cross, was found with an injury to its shoulder in Newland Park, Bideford.\n\nRSPCA inspector, Katie Forster, said: “This is absolutely appalling.\n\n“We are asking members of the public to be vigilant, especially in relation to wildlife.\n\n“Sadly, we do not know how the animal sustained this injury.\n\n“We are keeping an open mind as to what might have happened, but if you have any information that could help us please get in touch.\n\n“We do have some leads but would welcome further information as this would allow us to progress our investigation.\n\n“This could have been a lot worse and it is shocking that this dog has been shot.\n\n“I am appealing to members of the public to help us in our enquiries and help find the person responsible for doing this.\n\n“We do not know what the outcome of this may be for the dog but in cases like this the most likely outcome is that the animal will be put to sleep.\n\n“We are working closely with the police on this case and they are assisting with our enquiries.”\n\nAnyone with information should contact the RSPCA appeal line on 0300 123 8018.
