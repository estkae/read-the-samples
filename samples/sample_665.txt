The Egyptian government is to impose a tax on the purchase of gold in an effort to halt a rapid depreciation in the value of the Egyptian pound.\n\nThe move comes as Egypt is also struggling to curb inflation as well as a shortage of foreign currency to finance imports.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance is imposing a 15 percent tax on the sale of gold and a 20 percent tax on the sale of gold jewellery.\n\nThe move is aimed at preventing the conversion of gold into currency which is fuelling inflation.\n\nUnder the Egyptian Constitution, it is illegal to convert gold into currency.\n\nThe collapse in the value of the pound, which is currently trading at its lowest rate since 2004, has prompted a rush to gold as people try to protect their wealth.\n\nSince the 2011 revolution, the Egyptian pound has lost around 60 percent of its value against the dollar.\n\nEgypt is still suffering from a shortage of dollars which are needed to finance imports of food, medicine and fuel.\n\nThe government is now considering a $10 billion dollar loan from the International Monetary Fund.
