Fried chicken is probably my favorite thing to eat ever. Well, maybe besides waffles. And even though the oil can give me a headache if I smell it, I have yet to meet a fried chicken recipe I didn't like.\n\nBut one thing I have yet to figure out is why fried chicken is so often served as a part of a combo meal at fast food restaurants. Do they want you to try it because it's so delicious, or are they hoping that you'll order it and not want to take the time to study the other menu options?\n\nAnd why isn't it offered as a stand-alone item? A meal at KFC that includes a two-piece chicken meal, three sides, and a large drink, is about $11. A chicken meal with a side, biscuit, and drink is $7.50. Why don't they just cut out the middleman and offer a four-piece meal at the price of a three-piece meal?
