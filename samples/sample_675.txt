"At the moment, one of the biggest news in the cryptocurrency world is that EOS (EOS) blockchain is going live on June 1st. This is of course great news, but is it enough to attract investors and businesses to this new project?\n\nHere are five things you need to know about EOS.\n\n1. The EOS is the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap\n\nRight now, EOS is the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in the world with a total market cap of over 14 billion dollars. You will also find out that this is way behind of the biggest one – bitcoin, with almost $250 billion total market cap.\n\n2. EOS is a platform, not a token\n\nAs mentioned above, EOS is not a token – it is a platform that allows developers to create apps on the EOS blockchain. While this may sound strange to some people, you can easily see the reasoning behind this.\n\nWith EOS, all dApps on the platform will work with each other in order to create a better end-user experience. EOS is also designed to provide the possibility for the new developers to launch their applications in a few minutes, without having to write any code.\n\nEOS has a great potential because its founders are already the creators of one of the most popular crypto platforms – Block.one, which also made a lot of money from its $4 billion token sale last year.\n\n3. EOS wants to become a better Ethereum\n\nMany people claim that EOS wants to become a better version of Ethereum. They are also looking to become the most powerful infrastructure for dApp developers, and they are also targeting some of the biggest industries like social media, finance, supply chain, healthcare, and others.\n\n4. EOS launched its first dApp called ‘Plebs’\n\nOne of the first dApps that will launch on the EOS platform is called “Plebs”. This is a social network for blockchain enthusiasts and cryptocurrency traders. The first thing that you will notice when you log in is the “cryptocurrency wallet” button that will allow users to trade all sorts of tokens on the platform.\n\n5. EOS’ token distribution was one of the biggest in history\n\nEOS managed to raise almost $4 billion from its token distribution event back in 2017. For comparison, the second biggest crowd sale was for Ethereum, which managed to raise $18 million in the same year.\n\nWhile EOS has an interesting approach and has a good team, the launch of EOS MainNet will determine whether this project will succeed or not. The first version of EOS MainNet is expected to go live on June 1st, 2018.\n\nWe will be updating our subscribers as soon as we know more.
