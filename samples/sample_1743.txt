"High-speed DSL service has arrived in Seattle, the latest advance in the Internet revolution that's making it easier to work from home or conduct business online.\n\nNearly 200,000 Seattle-area homes are now capable of downloading data at speeds up to 15 megabits per second, compared to the 56 kilobits per second commonly available at homes and offices.\n\nDSL, or digital subscriber line, delivers data signals through traditional phone lines instead of cable. And it's the most common high-speed service being marketed to residential customers in the United States.\n\nUntil now, DSL has been unavailable in Seattle because of inadequate wiring.\n\n"We are very pleased that a fast, reliable broadband solution is now available to homes in the Seattle area," said Mayor Greg Nickels.\n\nBell Atlantic, which owns the local phone company, was the first to offer the service in the Seattle area, followed by RCN and Qwest. Qwest announced Thursday that it would offer DSL for $29.95 a month.\n\n"You're talking about a 10-fold increase in speed and at least that in terms of dollars," said Roger Entner, an analyst for Yankee Group, a market research firm in Boston. "This is the most significant breakthrough we've seen in the last 10 years in terms of bandwidth."\n\nThe new service, available in Seattle and Bellevue, is expected to stimulate the local economy as well.\n\n"Seattle's leading-edge broadband network will help keep our region's economy strong and growing, and this is good news for families and businesses," Nickels said.\n\nFaster speeds can help consumers, particularly if they want to make use of video-on-demand, online gaming and file-sharing services, said Dave Chapman, vice president of business development for RCN, the Philadelphia-based Internet service provider that's been providing high-speed service in Seattle since December.\n\nThe potential for making money online also is expected to increase with faster speeds.\n\n"With DSL, you don't need to have a big office space to do business anymore," Entner said. "Businesspeople will be able to be online anywhere."\n\nMore than 80 percent of the homes in Seattle are already wired for high-speed Internet service, but that still leaves nearly 50,000 homes that aren't connected to cable or DSL.\n\nIn those areas, fiber optics might be the next generation of high-speed Internet access.\n\nThe city of Seattle, where 40 percent of the population lacks high-speed access, announced last year it would seek a broadband partner. Officials are expected to announce a fiber-optics agreement soon.\n\n"As this latest technology moves into Seattle, our home-grown technology also is moving closer to becoming a reality," Nickels said. "Soon, we will have a state-of-the-art broadband network that will deliver high-speed access to all of Seattle."\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nSteve Wilhelm can be reached at 206-448-8334 or steve.wilhelm@seattlepi.com.
