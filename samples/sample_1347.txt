"Federal employees interested in supporting the American Cancer Society's research and patient services efforts can now make voluntary contributions via payroll deduction, according to a recent memorandum from the Federal Employees Payroll Deduction Donations for Charitable Organizations Program.\n\nThose interested in making the deductions can go to www.cancer.org/donate/payroll.html to fill out an authorization form. The form is then sent to FederalPay.org, a third-party provider that processes and authorizes the payroll deductions.\n\nFederalPay.org can also authorize and process contributions to the American Heart Association, the Arthritis Foundation, the American Lung Association, the Muscular Dystrophy Association and the United Way.\n\nThe program also accepts contributions through the Combined Federal Campaign, which currently is in its 2013 campaign.
