In the 1990s, few were more inventive or promising than this outfit from L'Aquila, which shifted through a good many stages and styles on its demos. With this new full-length recording the band's members have demonstrated a fairly predictable slide into the darkened pit of Rock and in the process produced music that is not only not all that interesting but which is rather uninspired. The album is simply long and the song writing predictable. The worst thing is that it is all the more boring because of the pretentious nature of the packaging and the band's name. - Ali "The Metallian"\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviews\n\n
