"I already have a Twitter account, how do I link it to my new site?\n\nThe easiest way is to log into Twitter from your Newshosting account and click the 'Activate' button that will appear after you click the Twitter option.\n\nPlease note: This will log you into Twitter and will automatically start posting content on your Twitter page. We do not keep your password information, and you will need to go into your Twitter account and remove any application you no longer wish to use.\n\nYou can find instructions on logging into Twitter here.
