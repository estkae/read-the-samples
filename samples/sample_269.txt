The legacy of past security problems with GM vehicles has forced GM to recall more than 6 million vehicles over the past decade, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nGM made most of the recent recalls, including those for ignition switch and power steering problems.\n\nThe automaker will appear before Congress this week to answer questions about its handling of the ignition switch problem. It faces lawsuits from owners of vehicles that were part of the recall, and also faces a criminal investigation.\n\nRep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) released a list of recalls from the NHTSA. DeGette has proposed legislation that would require the NHTSA to assess how automakers handled vehicle defects and how their actions impacted safety.\n\nThe data below is taken directly from the NHTSA. The list does not include recalls from the agency's other administrative offices, including the Offices of Defects Investigation.\n\nAlso, the NHTSA does not keep data for recalls issued in the 1950s.\n\n2013: 2.3 million\n\n2012: 1.3 million\n\n2011: 1.3 million\n\n2010: 1.1 million\n\n2009: 710,000\n\n2008: 780,000\n\n2007: 650,000\n\n2006: 480,000\n\n2005: 360,000\n\n2004: 290,000\n\n2003: 290,000\n\n2002: 270,000\n\n2001: 300,000\n\n2000: 310,000\n\n1999: 260,000\n\n1998: 230,000\n\n1997: 260,000\n\n1996: 250,000\n\n1995: 230,000\n\n1994: 240,000\n\n1993: 200,000\n\n1992: 210,000\n\n1991: 220,000\n\n1990: 190,000\n\n1989: 190,000\n\n1988: 200,000\n\n1987: 180,000\n\n1986: 150,000\n\n1985: 140,000\n\n1984: 160,000\n\n1983: 140,000\n\n1982: 120,000\n\n1981: 100,000\n\n1980: 90,000\n\n1979: 90,000\n\n1978: 80,000\n\n1977: 70,000\n\n1976: 60,000\n\n1975: 60,000\n\n1974: 50,000\n\n1973: 50,000\n\n1972: 40,000\n\n1971: 40,000\n\n1970: 30,000\n\n1969: 20,000\n\n1968: 20,000\n\n1967: 10,000\n\n1966: 0\n\n1965: 0\n\n1964: 0\n\n1963: 0\n\n1962: 0\n\n1961: 0\n\n1960: 0\n\n1959: 0\n\n1958: 0\n\n1957: 0\n\n1956: 0\n\n1955: 0\n\n1954: 0\n\n1953: 0\n\n1952: 0\n\n1951: 0\n\n1950: 0\n\n1949: 0\n\n1948: 0\n\n1947: 0\n\n1946: 0\n\n1945: 0\n\n1944: 0\n\n1943: 0\n\n1942: 0\n\n1941: 0\n\n1940: 0\n\n1939: 0\n\n1938: 0\n\n1937: 0\n\n1936: 0\n\n1935: 0\n\n1934: 0\n\n1933: 0\n\n1932: 0\n\n1931: 0\n\n1930: 0\n\n1929: 0\n\n1928: 0\n\n1927: 0\n\n1926: 0\n\n1925: 0\n\n1924: 0\n\n1923: 0\n\n1922: 0\n\n1921: 0\n\n1920: 0\n\n1919: 0\n\n1918: 0\n\n1917: 0\n\n1916: 0\n\n1915: 0\n\n1914: 0\n\n1913: 0\n\n1912: 0\n\n1911: 0\n\n1910: 0\n\n1909: 0\n\n1908: 0\n\n1907: 0\n\n1906: 0\n\n1905: 0\n\n1904: 0\n\n1903: 0\n\n1902: 0\n\n1901: 0\n\n1900: 0\n\n1899: 0\n\n1898: 0\n\n1897: 0\n\n1896: 0\n\n1895: 0\n\n1894: 0\n\n1893: 0\n\n1892: 0\n\n1891: 0\n\n1890: 0\n\n1889: 0\n\n1888: 0\n\n1887: 0\n\n1886: 0\n\n1885: 0\n\n1884: 0\n\n1883: 0\n\n1882: 0\n\n1881: 0\n\n1880: 0\n\n1879: 0\n\n1878: 0\n\n1877: 0\n\n1876: 0\n\n1875: 0\n\n1874: 0\n\n1873: 0\n\n1872: 0\n\n1871: 0\n\n1870: 0\n\n1869: 0\n\n1868: 0\n\n1867: 0\n\n1866: 0\n\n1865: 0\n\n1864: 0\n\n1863: 0\n\n1862: 0\n\n1861: 0\n\n1860: 0\n\n1859: 0\n\n1858: 0\n\n1857: 0\n\n1856: 0\n\n1855: 0\n\n1854: 0\n\n1853: 0\n\n1852: 0\n\n1851: 0\n\n1850: 0\n\n1849: 0\n\n1848: 0\n\n1847: 0\n\n1846: 0\n\n1845: 0\n\n1844: 0\n\n1843: 0\n\n1842: 0\n\n1841: 0\n\n1840: 0\n\n1839: 0\n\n1838: 0\n\n1837: 0\n\n1836: 0\n\n1835: 0\n\n1834: 0\n\n1833: 0\n\n1832: 0\n\n1831: 0\n\n1830: 0\n\n1829: 0\n\n1828: 0\n\n1827: 0\n\n1826: 0\n\n1825: 0\n\n1824: 0\n\n1823: 0\n\n1822: 0\n\n1821: 0\n\n1820: 0\n\n1819: 0\n\n1818: 0\n\n1817: 0\n\n1816: 0\n\n1815: 0\n\n1814: 0\n\n1813: 0\n\n1812: 0\n\n1811: 0\n\n1810: 0\n\n1809: 0\n\n1808: 0\n\n1807: 0\n\n1806: 0\n\n1805: 0\n\n1804: 0\n\n1803: 0\n\n1802: 0\n\n1801: 0\n\n1800: 0\n\n1799: 0\n\n1798: 0\n\n1797: 0\n\n1796: 0\n\n1795: 0\n\n1794: 0\n\n1793: 0\n\n1792: 0\n\n1791: 0\n\n1790: 0\n\n1789: 0\n\n1788: 0\n\n1787: 0\n\n1786: 0\n\n1785: 0\n\n1784: 0\n\n1783: 0\n\n1782: 0\n\n1781: 0\n\n1780: 0\n\n1779: 0\n\n1778: 0\n\n1777: 0\n\n1776: 0\n\n1775: 0\n\n1774: 0\n\n1773: 0\n\n1772: 0\n\n1771: 0\n\n1770: 0\n\n1769: 0\n\n1768: 0\n\n1767: 0\n\n1766: 0\n\n1765: 0\n\n1764: 0\n\n1763: 0\n\n1762: 0\n\n1761: 0\n\n1760: 0\n\n1759: 0\n\n1758: 0\n\n1757: 0\n\n1756: 0\n\n1755: 0\n\n1754: 0\n\n1753: 0\n\n1752: 0\n\n1751: 0\n\n1750: 0\n\n1749: 0\n\n1748: 0\n\n1747: 0\n\n1746: 0\n\n1745: 0\n\n1744: 0\n\n1743: 0\n\n1742: 0\n\n1741: 0\n\n1740: 0\n\n1739: 0\n\n1738: 0\n\n1737: 0\n\n1736: 0\n\n1735: 0\n\n1734: 0\n\n1733: 0\n\n1732: 0\n\n1731: 0\n\n1730: 0\n\n1729: 0\n\n1728: 0\n\n1727: 0\n\n1726: 0\n\n1725: 0\n\n1724: 0\n\n1723: 0\n\n1722: 0\n\n1721: 0\n\n1720: 0\n\n1719: 0\n\n1718: 0\n\n1717: 0\n\n1716: 0\n\n1715: 0\n\n1714: 0
