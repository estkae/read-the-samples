Netrunner cards, cards, cards… that’s all there is to life right? I guess I’m a simple man. A simple man with a fondness for netrunner cards and digital art. While the cards themselves are only a small part of the game and often not even seen when playing, they’re the cards that start it all. The art is a big part of what attracts me to Netrunner. The crisp, bold designs that can also evoke feelings or tell stories. While I don’t play much anymore, I still enjoy going back to browse through these cards. So why not share some of the best in our Art Of… series.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis time we’re doing another twist on the series by not going for a specific set, instead we’re just looking at a selection of cards that all fall under the All That Remains expansion. A popular set that brought the art of Shouta Yasooka to the community. Shouta’s unique style of art captures the feel of the source material perfectly and comes across well in card form. All that remains really captures the essence of cyberpunk and provides the best of the theme as it should. If you’re interested in more from Shouta you can check out his gallery page and follow him on Twitter. He’s an amazing artist and we’re very lucky to have him.\n\nFirst off we have a staple in most netrunner decks – Corroder. I feel it was a great design choice for the ice to not only use the cutting through concept but also to keep the design clean and easy to read. The crisp lines really make it stand out and the subtle white detail behind the lines really work in creating the effect. This one really did jump out to me as a card that I was really happy to see and it helped create the whole idea of netrunner in the first place.\n\nZer0 is another great looking card. It perfectly illustrates the concept behind the character, as well as the nature of netrunner. The shadows, the gear and the very simple but effective colours all come together to form an impressive image. My only criticism is the green glow in the characters helmet. I don’t think it works well with the rest of the design and it’s just a little too much for my liking. Overall though it’s a great card.\n\nHere we have another great look at Shouta’s style. It has a classic look to it, not too complex but still complex enough to tell the story. It really does look like a worn newspaper. I’ve never actually played the original game it’s based on, which makes it even more impressive. I guess it’s time for me to go and play some D&D, as that’s exactly what this card evokes.\n\nThis is another favourite of mine. Shouta has a great way of depicting robots in a way that captures the soul of the robot but also the strength of a hardworking labourer. It’s this style that I really enjoy and is the main reason why I wanted to do this post.\n\nOne last card before I go. I know it’s a card that’s not as great, it’s a little weird, but I just really like the idea behind it. The art isn’t great but I really like the concept behind it. The biggest problem is the actual detail of the image. The box is a great idea but the sharp edges are too much for me. Again, this is an issue with the style of the artist. I really love the idea of it, I just don’t think it’s executed well enough.\n\nAll That Remains is a great expansion. One that I think a lot of us can agree on. It may be my bias towards Shouta’s work but I just think it�"
