The best remedy to our climate and energy challenges is a clean-energy transformation that leads to innovation, clean jobs and economic growth. The Clean Energy Standard (CES) will ensure that a large share of our electricity comes from renewable energy while keeping electricity rates affordable. This energy transformation will also create a new wave of innovation that will transform our electric sector and spur new economic growth.\n\nCES protects customers from electric price volatility by requiring that renewable energy sources be priced to meet or beat the cost of the fuels they displace â€“ coal, natural gas, and nuclear. A renewables portfolio standard requires wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources to be developed, and would allow renewable energy costs to rise as they become more expensive.
