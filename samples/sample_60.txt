A particular thanks also to Donnie Hall for all his practical support and guidance during my exploration of the Cuillin. I would also like to thank the helpful staff of the Skye Library in Kyle of Lochalsh, and Alison Connell for the excellent maps. I am grateful to the Climbers’ Club for publishing my article on the Cuillin.\n\nFinally, a big thank you to Sally, who has been a constant source of encouragement, inspiration and love, and to my family and friends who have given me endless support.\n\n\nPlate 1: Spade Level, Coire an Lochain, Glen Brittle, in winter\n\n\nPlate 2: View of the Beinn Eighe massif from the east\n\n\nPlate 3: Snow-filled Coire na Banachdich, Coire an Lochain\n\n\nPlate 4: Black Cuillin ridge from the Spade Level\n\n\nPlate 5: Near the end of the Black Cuillin ridge\n\n\nPlate 6: Climbers on the summit of Tower Ridge\n\n\nPlate 7: Skye seen from the summit of the Cuillin ridge\n\n\nPlate 8: Climbers near the summit of Clach Glas Arête\n\n\nPlate 9: Snow on the summit of An Dubh Sgeir\n\n\nPlate 10: Landscape of the Minnoch Burn\n\n\n1\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThe spectacular granite peaks of the Cuillin on the Isle of Skye have captured the imagination of hillwalkers and climbers for over a hundred years. When George Henry Alcock (1864–1941), a climber and mountaineer, visited the Cuillin in 1893, he wrote in his book Through the Highlands and Islands of Scotland:\n\nNo one who had not seen the Black Cuillin and the peculiar forms which the rocks assume would believe that nature could assume such strange shapes as are seen here. The first view of the Cuillin from the south makes them look like a huge fortress of rock, with fantastic turrets and chimneys, and battlemented walls.\n\n\nToday these classic features, viewed from the slopes of the nearby mountains of the mainland, such as the Beinn Eighe and Mòine Mhòr, have hardly changed. But the Cuillin are not just aesthetically pleasing. To their first British explorers in the mid-nineteenth century, the Black Cuillin, which form a massive ridge running from Coire an Lochain in Glen Brittle to An Dubh Sgeir, seemed a forbidding mountain barrier, ‘a fortress of rock’. Their modern reputation, and that of the smaller range of the Red Cuillin to the south-east, as a major challenge to both rock climbers and mountaineers, was established during the second half of the twentieth century. However, despite the presence of the two main ridges on the Black Cuillin (North-West Ridge and Central Ridge), many individual peaks, and the climbing routes up them, were relatively unexplored. This was to change in the 1970s and 1980s when many of the hard, mixed and winter routes, most of which were first climbed in the Cuillin, were recorded by enthusiastic pioneers. Today, climbing and scrambling in the Cuillin can be combined with hillwalking, and the varied routes, combined with the varied weather of Skye, offer an extremely satisfying and testing experience for a mountaineer.\n\nIn writing this guidebook, I have had to make many decisions regarding what routes to describe, and which to omit. Many climbers may not agree with my choices, and it is inevitable that a guidebook such as this will not be comprehensive. As well as describing my chosen routes, I have tried to include a range of other interesting aspects of the Cuillin, in order to make the book relevant to anyone interested in a mountaineering trip to Skye.\n\nGeology\n\nThe geology of Skye, and especially the Cuillin, is fascinating, and as well as a number of peaks and ridges, it has given rise to a series of dramatic glens, the upper parts of which are in the Inaccessible Pinnacle (Coire nam Bian) to the north of the main ridge. The Black Cuillin consist of metamorphic rocks which were formed as a result of a major mountain-building event in the Caledonian Orogeny, the mountain-building event which took place between 500 and 400 million years ago. At this time, a number of folds (anticlines and synclines) were formed, some of which can be seen today. The Blue Stack of the Old Man of Storr, for example, was the result of the raising up of a syncline (Fig. 1). This event also resulted in the granite being exposed to the surface, but this did not happen everywhere. To the east of the island, most of Skye is underlain by metamorphic rocks, but to the west, particularly on the western coast of the Trotternish peninsula, granite is exposed. The Blue Stack is also part of a major fold which has resulted in the formation of the Trotternish Ridge.\n\nFigure 1. The Blue Stack of the Old Man of Storr.\n\n\nThese major events have also resulted in a relatively complex geological map, with three main rock types (Fig. 2). A general layer of granite, called the Inaccessible Pinnacle Quartz Diorite, extends from the Blue Stack north-eastwards to Beinn Eighe. This granite has been intruded by the Red Cuillin Granite, which has a different composition and thus has different characteristics to the underlying rock. In the central and eastern parts of the main ridge of the Black Cuillin, the rocks are composed of the Papcastle Gneiss, which is a granitic metamorphic rock. However, to the west, around Sgurr nan Gillean and Glas Bheinn, the Papcastle Gneiss has been intruded by the Kintail Granite, giving rise to a more mottled appearance in this part of the Cuillin. A further complex of rocks is exposed on the north side of Glen Brittle, which includes the Torridonian Sandstone, Lewisian Gneiss, and Dalradian schists.\n\nFigure 2.

With so many ridges and peaks, there is much to explore, and each summit offers its own rewards. Some of the individual peaks are not very high, but offer serious scrambles and rock climbs, while others, such as the highest summit of Sgurr nan Gillean (1,018 m) and the first major peak on the Central Cuillin Ridge, Sgurr Dearg (974 m), offer impressive views.
