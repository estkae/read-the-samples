WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday that the U.S. government was looking into whether any former or serving Russian intelligence officials were linked to the authorship of recent hacking attacks, but declined to comment further.\n\nThe U.S. government last week formally accused Russia for the first time of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election.\n\n"Well, I'm not going to tell you we have it all tied up with a bow, because we do not have it tied up with a bow," Tillerson said in an interview on "Fox News Sunday," asked whether Russia was responsible for the cyber attacks.\n\n"But I will say this: We know that part of our challenge is in the cyber realm."\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin directed a covert effort through hacking and propaganda to try to tilt the election in favor of Republican Donald Trump.\n\nRussia has denied any such activity.\n\nU.S. Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer, the incoming Senate Democratic leader, said on ABC's "This Week" program that he expected the U.S. Congress would investigate whether Russia used hacking to influence the election.\n\n"We are more and more focused on getting to the bottom of this," said Schumer, adding it was "odd" Trump was not talking more about allegations of Russian hacking.\n\n"I think we could do better on that, because this is pretty serious," Schumer said.\n\n'MORE ACCURATE'\n\nAsked on CBS' "Face the Nation" whether he thought the election was "free and fair from a cybersecurity perspective," Tillerson said, "Well, I don't think there's any question that the Russians were playing around in our electoral processes."\n\n"I think the question is, is it incontrovertible, and can we prove in a court of law, that Russia is responsible for how our elections turned out?" Tillerson said.\n\nOn NBC's "Meet the Press," he called allegations that Russia interfered in the U.S. election "very troubling" and said they were already "being looked at."\n\n"But we also, I think, need to be very clear that we can't allow some foreign government to come in, particularly one like Russia, and interfere, how elections are going to be carried out in the United States or any other country," he said.\n\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, has said the focus on Russia's alleged hacking campaign is a "political witch hunt" by his opponents.\n\nRussian officials, including Putin, have repeatedly denied that Russia tried to influence the U.S. presidential election.\n\nTillerson also took a swipe at Trump for comparing U.S. intelligence agencies to Nazi Germany in dismissing reports Russia had compiled compromising information on Trump.\n\n"Those kind of comments are obviously ... unnecessary, and frankly, I think, damaging to our intelligence officers," Tillerson"
