A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s decision to end protections for almost 800,000 young immigrants. U.S. District Judge William Alsup ruled on Tuesday that the program “must stay” in place while lawsuits against the Trump administration continue.\n\nIn a 48-page ruling, Alsup said the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, must remain in effect as challenges to the decision by the Trump administration to end the program move forward. The judge’s ruling does not require the government to accept new applications for DACA protections.\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration said it would end DACA, which President Obama had implemented in 2012 to provide work permits and temporary protection from deportation to hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the country illegally as children.\n\nDACA recipients are commonly known as “dreamers,” after the DREAM Act, legislation that would have provided them a path to citizenship. The bill has been introduced multiple times in Congress but has failed to pass. The Supreme Court is expected to soon rule on whether Trump acted legally when he moved to end DACA.\n\nThe DACA program provides two-year renewable work permits to eligible immigrants who came to the U.S. before the age of 16. They must have a high school diploma or GED and must not have a criminal record. The move by Trump to rescind DACA prompted a flurry of lawsuits across the country.\n\nAlsup, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, ruled on Tuesday that the plaintiffs challenging Trump’s decision “have shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the rescission of DACA was arbitrary and capricious.”\n\nThe judge wrote in his ruling that the Department of Homeland Security’s “legal judgment” was “virtually unexplained” and did not “offend” the law. The court papers filed by the department’s lawyers offered “no solid basis” for the finding that DACA was unlawful and unconstitutional, Alsup said.\n\nThe ruling was met with a jubilant response from supporters of DACA, who were in court in San Francisco on Tuesday to hear the judge’s decision.\n\nEvan Wolfson, president of the group Freedom for Immigrants, said, “The judge’s decision, that DACA must stay in place while the legal cases play out, is a major blow to the Trump administration’s cruel and xenophobic assault on immigrant youth.”\n\nAdvocates for DACA recipients, however, will need to keep up"
