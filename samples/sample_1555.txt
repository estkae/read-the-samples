And he’s quickly learning what it’s like to be a black man in a white Republican state.\n\nThe Tallahassee mayor gave a blistering speech at the Florida Democratic Party’s state convention in Fort Lauderdale on Thursday.\n\nDuring his speech, Gillum pointed out that he’s an unabashedly liberal Democrat who supports policies that put people before corporations.\n\n“I’m not afraid to stand up for what’s right, even if it’s not popular,” Gillum said. “I know what it looks like for those in power to withhold opportunities from those who need it most. It’s called corruption.”\n\nThe mayor is the frontrunner in the race for governor, but it hasn’t come without a cost. He’s received threats from racists.\n\nAndrew Gillum says he's had death threats as a result of being the Democratic frontrunner for Florida governor https://t.co/XkAZqw1uPO pic.twitter.com/E9FV1eZxUq — CNN (@CNN) March 10, 2018\n\nGillum pointed out the subtle racism that he’s encountered as he’s risen in the ranks of politics in Florida.\n\n“I’ve had people call me a monkey,” Gillum said. “I’ve had people call me a skunk. I’ve had people call me a coon. I’ve had people talk about my body parts in ways that they shouldn’t.”\n\nGillum also pointed out that he had been “a target of racists.”\n\nThe mayor said it’s time to stand up against the racism that is plaguing the state of Florida.\n\n“When we decided to stand up to the NRA and we started talking about a ban on assault weapons, that we would be called racist, that was the part that bothered me the most,” Gillum said. “I don’t know about you, but I’m tired of that. I’m tired of the silence of good people.”\n\nAnd Gillum is more than ready to be the next Democratic governor of Florida.\n\n“It’s time for the same energy that we brought to taking back our state House and our state Senate and our governor’s mansion,” he said. “It’s time to bring that same energy to take back our country.”\n\nWatch:
