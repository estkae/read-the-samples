Life is hard sometimes. I know that for me it has been difficult to not only reach out to people but to let people in. I have always been an introvert, with a heart for serving, but for a long time I didn't understand the world around me. It seemed like everyone around me was doing the things that they were called to do, and I wasn't. The loneliness would at times seem unbearable. But what I have learned over the past few years is that we are all called to serve, and what feels like our personal inadequacy can actually be the way in which God is working in and through us. In his word, we are shown stories of men who were not special in any way, but were used by God in ways that have impacted the lives of generations. God can and will use us, and while we may not see what we are doing as worthwhile, He does. He uses each of us in our own unique way to bring his kingdom to earth. This Christmas season, open your eyes to the way that God is working in and through you. He doesn't need to use you in an outstanding way to make a difference, he just needs to use you.
