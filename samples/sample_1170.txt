"A study on the mental health of transgender individuals\n\nUnderstanding the Impact of Discrimination on Mental Health in Transgender People.\n\nThis study looked at the impact of discrimination on the mental health of transgender people.\n\nThere is a paucity of research on the health status of transgender people and, in particular, the impact of discrimination on their health.\n\nA better understanding of the mental health of transgender people is therefore urgently needed to inform the development of evidence-based practice for reducing the impact of stigma and improving the health of transgender people.\n\nIn order to address this gap in the research, this study looked at the impact of discrimination on mental health of transgender individuals using a cross-sectional design.\n\nForty-three transgender adults (41.9% male-to-female and 58.1% female-to-male) from the US-based Transgender Discrimination Survey were analysed using logistic regression.\n\nStudy details\n\nResults\n\nThe study found that experiences of discrimination were common in the preceding year and were strongly associated with lifetime mental health problems.\n\nIndividuals who reported discrimination had a greater prevalence of mental health issues, including depression (Odds Ratio = 2.54, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.11–5.80), anxiety disorder (OR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.29–4.71), post-traumatic stress disorder (OR = 2.63, 95% CI: 1.13–6.05), alcohol problems (OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.03–3.58), and suicide attempt (OR = 2.36, 95% CI: 1.23–4.53).\n\nThese results highlight the potential impact of discrimination on mental health of transgender individuals, and further underscore the need for public health strategies to address the impact of stigma and discrimination on the health and well-being of transgender people.\n\nHow the results can be used\n\nThis study highlights the important impact that discrimination can have on the mental health of transgender individuals.\n\nAs this was a cross-sectional study, it is not possible to determine if discrimination preceded the mental health problems, but this is likely to be the case.\n\nWhat this study adds\n\nThis is one of the first studies to identify the prevalence of discrimination and its association with mental health problems among transgender people.\n\nThe results support the need to develop public health strategies to reduce the impact of stigma and discrimination on the health of transgender individuals.\n\nFurther research is needed to establish the direction of causation between discrimination and mental health outcomes.\n\nFor more information contact:\n\nThe study, published in the journal Health Affairs , looked at the impact of discrimination on the mental health of transgender people.\n\nResearchers from the University of Washington and University of Arizona analysed data from the 2011–12 US Transgender Discrimination Survey, which assessed the impact of discrimination and violence on transgender adults.\n\nThe results showed that experiences of discrimination were common in the preceding year, with 33.1% of respondents reporting experiences of discrimination in employment, 26.7% in the provision of health care, 22.4% in the education system, 21.8% in public accommodations, and 34.2% in the judicial system.\n\nThis study also found that experiences of discrimination were strongly associated with lifetime mental health problems.\n\nIndividuals who reported discrimination had a greater prevalence of mental health issues, including depression (odds ratio = 2.54, 95% confidence interval: 1.11–5.80), anxiety disorder (odds ratio = 2.45, 95% confidence interval: 1.29–4.71), post-traumatic stress disorder (odds ratio = 2.63, 95% confidence interval: 1.13–6.05), alcohol problems (odds ratio = 1.93, 95% confidence interval: 1.03–3.58), and suicide attempt (odds ratio = 2.36, 95% confidence interval: 1.23–4.53).\n\nThis study shows that discrimination is common among transgender individuals in the US.\n\nIt suggests that the adverse mental health consequences of discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression are prevalent in this population and should be addressed by the implementation of anti-discrimination policies.\n\nRead more on Elsevier Connect.\n\nResearchers from the University of Washington in the US and University of Arizona in the US carried out the study.
