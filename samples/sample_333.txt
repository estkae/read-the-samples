"When you have a lot of money and power, sometimes you think you can buy yourself out of anything." ―Ben Urich [src]\n\nJohn Bushmaster was a powerful crime boss and drug dealer, having inherited control of Harlem's Paradise after his brother, Quincy, was shot and killed by Luke Cage. Bushmaster was also the head of the ruthless Bushmaster drug cartel.\n\nContents show]\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\nNot much is known about John Bushmaster's early life, except that he was once involved in organized crime. He became a drug lord and took over his brother's position as head of Harlem's Paradise. He later became involved in the criminal organization known as the Hand.[1]\n\nLuke Cage's Power\n\n"Tell me where they took Misty Knight."\n\n"What are you going to do with me?"\n\n"Well, I'm not going to let you walk away."\n\n"Who's going to stop me?"\n\n"Luke Cage." ―Luke Cage and Bushmaster [src]\n\nWhen Bushmaster witnessed Luke Cage throw a man out of Harlem's Paradise for harassing some young women, he asked his brother, Quincy, to help him get rid of the unruly patron. The next day, Bushmaster called the man who was threatening to sue Harlem's Paradise and threatened to kill him. When Cage returned, Bushmaster tried to persuade Cage to leave by telling him he did not belong there. Bushmaster revealed to Cage that his name was John Bushmaster and that he was the owner of Harlem's Paradise. When Cage insisted that he would be staying, Bushmaster noted that he did not know who he was messing with before Cage told him he was messing with Luke Cage.\n\nCage remained in Harlem's Paradise and caused problems for Bushmaster, much to his annoyance. Bushmaster and his men began selling the Bushmaster drug throughout Harlem. Cage overheard Bushmaster's name when it was said by his brother Quincy during a phone call. When Cage visited Bushmaster at Harlem's Paradise and accused him of being behind the Bushmaster drug, he denied it and told Cage to leave. Bushmaster's men, however, confronted Cage and attacked him. Cage easily overpowered all of them and escaped from Harlem's Paradise.[1]\n\nChasing Misty Knight\n\n"I'm getting sick of your bullshit."\n\n"Is that what you tell all the girls?" ―Bushmaster and Misty Knight [src]\n\nWhen Cage attacked one of Bushmaster's drug warehouses and threatened to kill Bushmaster if he did not tell him where he was keeping Misty Knight, Bushmaster told him that he did not know what he was talking about and Cage attacked him. Bushmaster ordered his men to shoot Cage while he escaped. The bullets did nothing to Cage as they could not penetrate his skin.\n\nBushmaster visited Pop's Barber Shop and threatened to burn down Pop's Barber Shop and kill everyone inside if he did not get a haircut, including the young girl named Tilda Johnson, who could do a mean cornrows, before he left. Tilda snuck out of the shop and stole Bushmaster's car while he was inside getting a shave. Bushmaster ran outside and found Tilda attempting to get away. He then chased after Tilda in the stolen car.\n\nTilda was able to evade Bushmaster's pursuit until he was able to push her car off the road and caused her car to roll over and crash. Bushmaster dragged Tilda from her car and found out who she was. Tilda, however, was rescued by a bystander who had witnessed the entire incident and called the police. Bushmaster was arrested for kidnapping, but he was released from police custody later.[2]\n\nBusiness Proposition\n\n"Now, we are making money, yes, but not as much as we should. It's a competitive market, man. You're good. And that girl, well, she's something else. I'm offering you a piece of this action. 25% for the both of you."\n\n"That's not how this works."\n\n"You know what? It is how this works. It's time for you to grow up." ―Bushmaster and Shades [src]\n\nBack at Harlem's Paradise, Bushmaster offered Shades a percentage of his drug business, but Shades refused. Bushmaster made an offer to Diamondback to sell him some of his product in exchange for a fee. Bushmaster met with Shades, who berated him for not being a better businessman and selling to Diamondback. Shades told Bushmaster that he was selling drugs on his own, but Bushmaster told him that he had a plan to sell his drugs in Bushmaster branded bullets. Bushmaster then attempted to seduce Shades' wife, Tilda Johnson, but she refused his advances.\n\nThe next day, Bushmaster gave a speech to the patrons of Harlem's Paradise as they celebrated the end of their evening. Bushmaster boasted about his power and demanded that they bow to him, but was met with little response. Shades then insulted Bushmaster, who then drew his gun on Shades. Luke Cage then attacked Bushmaster, but Bushmaster managed to get the upper hand and beat Cage into submission. As Bushmaster prepared to shoot Cage, Tilda Johnson shot Bushmaster in the chest with a concealed gun and stole his gun, with Shades shooting the other members of Bushmaster's entourage before they could react.\n\nBushmaster and his men went into hiding at a warehouse, where Bushmaster furiously scolded Shades for his betrayal. Shades explained that he had been working with Diamondback, but now wanted to make a better life for himself and his wife. Bushmaster, realizing that Shades had a point, agreed to go into hiding for the night. The next day, Bushmaster was visited by Knight, Shades, and Cage. Knight had returned to take back Harlem's Paradise. Knight gave Bushmaster a chance to surrender, but Bushmaster refused and attempted to shoot Knight, but was overpowered by Cage and Knight, forcing him to surrender.\n\nWhile Knight and Cage prepared to transport Bushmaster to Ryker's Island, Bushmaster told them that the shipment of drugs would be arriving that night. The police tried to stop the convoy, but the SWAT team was gunned down by Bushmaster's men. Knight decided to attack the warehouse to stop the shipment from getting to New York. Knight, Cage, and Bushmaster fought his men while Tilda Johnson fought Diamondback and his men, although Diamondback managed to escape from the scene.\n\nOnce Knight and Cage subdued the rest of Bushmaster's men, Knight interrogated Bushmaster about where the shipment was. Bushmaster told them that the guns had already been sold to a man named Ricky. Knight and Cage traveled to a diner to look for Ricky, where they found Ricky talking to his partner Rico. Knight threatened Ricky into giving her the location of the shipment. Once Ricky told Knight the location, she and Cage drove to the location where the guns were being shipped. Knight was able to steal the guns from the men who were shipping them, but one of Bushmaster's men threw a grenade into the truck. Cage managed to catch the grenade and toss it back at Bushmaster's men, but was then hit by the truck, knocking him unconscious. Knight ran Cage to the hospital while Bushmaster's men reclaimed their guns and returned them to Bushmaster.[3]\n\nPersonality\n\nTo be added\n\nAbilities\n\nExpert Combatant : Bushmaster was an expert hand-to-hand combatant, as he was able to easily fight off Luke Cage with little effort.\n\n: Bushmaster was an expert hand-to-hand combatant, as he was able to easily fight off Luke Cage with little effort.
