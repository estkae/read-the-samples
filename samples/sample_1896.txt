1988 VFL season\n\nThe 1988 Victorian Football League season was the 92nd season of the elite Australian rules football competition.\n\nIn 1988, the VFL competition consisted of twelve teams of 18 on-the-field players each, plus two substitute players, known as the 19th man and the 20th man. A player could be substituted for any reason; however, once substituted, a player could not return to the field of play under any circumstances.\n\nTeams played each other in a home-and-away season of 20 rounds; matches 12 to 20 were the "home-and-way reverse" of matches 1 to 9.\n\nOnce the 20 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1988 VFL "Premiers" were determined by the specific format and conventions of the McIntyre Final Five system.\n\nThe night series were held under the floodlights at Lake Oval, South Melbourne, for the teams (5th to 12th on ladder) out of the finals at the end of the home and away rounds.\n\nFinal: Fitzroy 10.11 (71) defeated Richmond 8.8 (56).\n\n\n\n\n
