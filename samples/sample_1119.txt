\n\nFrom: Duke of Norfolk\n\nTo: Anne Mowbray, Duchess of Norfolk\n\nSent: 27 July 1476\n\nIn the late 1470s, William, the 4th Duke of Norfolk and 2nd Earl of Surrey, became embroiled in a dispute with his second wife Anne, Duchess of Norfolk, and her younger sister Isabel, the widow of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke. The daughters of the 1st Earl of Westmoreland, Isabel and Anne shared a strong affinity with the Pastons. This is evidenced by the presence of John Paston II and John Paston III at the former's wedding to Sir John Fastolf's heir, John Fastolf, and the marriage of Isabel's stepdaughter Margaret Herbert to John Paston II.\n\nAnne and Isabel's conflict with the Duke of Norfolk reached its peak in 1476. That year, William FitzAlan, the 11th Earl of Arundel, died without issue, leaving the bulk of his estates to his widow, Anne, Duchess of Norfolk. However, a clause in the Earl's will made provision for his illegitimate son, Henry FitzAlan. Anne immediately asserted her rights to the FitzAlan estates and sought to deny her husband access to them. On 15 June, the Duke of Norfolk demanded that the Duchess of Norfolk present him with the estate accounts. In response, Anne wrote to her husband's steward, William Gresham, on the 23rd June, reminding him of her ownership of the FitzAlan properties and asserting that her husband was in no position to demand anything from her.\n\nAnne's response to her husband was prompted by her husband's decision to leave court in order to attend to his various estates, during which time he met with his wife. The Duke and Duchess of Norfolk returned to court by July. This letter was sent by Anne in response to her husband's demands, some time after their return.\n\n\n\nLondon\n\nJuly the 27th 1476\n\n\n\n[On a loose piece of paper, now preserved among the Paston Letters, is the following:-\n\n\n\n'My ryght worchepful and most dradd and ryght hartely belovyd husbande, the soth [truth] ys that of ryght and of lawe the I have the maner of Arundell in thes myldren of Arundell [marches] and your steward ys reasenably bysted with me therof, wherfor my most humble and humbyll desyre is to youre noble grace that my fadyr mynde and his will maye be in thes myldren done, for, as for me, I have not, and never had, tytle to no myldren myn, for they be my lordes and to holde thes myldren agaynst his will is bot myche myschyld [mischief]. Wherfore yf ye love me, ye most be good lorde and myldre myht be in these myldren done, or ellis your faytheful duchess shall not longe dwell wyth youre grace; for, if I have thes myldren not, I shall gett a good ynchese [inchcease] [better in case of difficulty] of youre grace; for all the world seyth that your grace moste [must] departe with me to those myldren or ellis I most departe with youre grace, and God kepe youre grace, for your ryght worchepfull and most dradd and ryght hartely belovyd wife.']\n\n\n\n\n\n
