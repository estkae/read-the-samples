Welcome to Overnighter, where we search for awesome, upcoming, unknown restaurants and bars all over the city. This week, we take a look at the promising Asian food scene on the UWS.\n\n\n\nMUST EATS:\n\nWild Ginger:\n\nThere’s no shortage of Asian food on the Upper West Side, but the arrival of Wild Ginger at 67th and Amsterdam has upped the game. With flavors of Vietnam and Thailand, there’s plenty to enjoy and keep you coming back. Plus, the atmosphere is lovely and fun with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating to eat in or take out. The crispy tofu appetizer is especially addictive and not something you’ll find anywhere else in the city.\n\n\n\nLe Dragon:\n\nLe Dragon is a family-run spot on Amsterdam and 79th with some seriously authentic Asian cuisine. Everything is cooked to order, which means you’ll need to wait a few minutes to eat, but it’s well worth it. You’ll find a few small tables and lots of takeout orders but if you can grab a table, do it. The steamed buns are a great start (the pork is our favorite) and the crispy fish comes highly recommended. With classic Asian dishes like shrimp with cashew nuts and beef with broccoli, this is a spot where you can keep coming back for more.\n\n\n\nChinatown Supermarket:\n\nYou might pass by Chinatown Supermarket on the corner of Broadway and 76th Street and not give it a second look, but it’s actually a great resource for Asian ingredients and staples that you’ll need for the recipes you pick up from Le Dragon or the market next door. You can also buy a few delicious things to snack on from the grocery store, which also offers a hot food counter in the back of the store. The spicy squid and jian bing (Chinese crepes) are two of our favorites.
