Each year, the Duluth News Tribune names a Great Duluthian. This year's Great Duluthian is Bernie Betz, founder and president of Betz Equipment.\n\nBetz, an avid hunter and fisherman, is not only a successful business man, he is a giver. His Betz Family Foundation has donated over $5 million to various organizations and projects, including Duluth's Discovery Center and the Betz Sportsman's Club, which has operated since 1948.\n\n"It has been a real honor to know Bernie, work with him, and to benefit from his support," says John Stowe, president and CEO of the Duluth Entertainment Convention Center (DECC).\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Betz shared a quote from Henry Ford: "If you think you can do a thing, or if you think you can't do a thing, you're right." Betz says he tries to follow this philosophy in all aspects of his life.\n\nBetz said that there are too many good people in Duluth to name one "Great Duluthian," but he humbly accepted the award. "This is just a thank you," Betz said. "I thank you for this.\
