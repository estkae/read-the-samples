"Australian Energy Regulator highlights South Australian electricity network overspend\n\nThe Australian Energy Regulator has released a draft report highlighting the network cost of electricity distribution in South Australia. The report contains the results of an investigation into South Australian electricity distribution costs undertaken by the Australian Energy Regulator (AER).\n\nThe AERâ€™s report found that the electricity distribution networks in South Australia, namely ElectraNet and SA Power Networks, are materially overspending compared to the amount of revenue they receive from consumers.\n\nThe report states that network costs in South Australia have been growing rapidly, due to a range of factors, including but not limited to:\n\nLow and decreasing real term retail revenue\n\nPoor use of time based network costs\n\nTime based revenue regulation\n\nChanging end-user demand for electricity\n\nInvestments in the network that are not supported by regulation.\n\nThe report further states that distribution charges represent around a quarter of the total cost of electricity, and are ultimately passed on to consumers through higher electricity bills. The report notes that the three largest state owned electricity distribution companies (including ElectraNet and SA Power Networks) have all seen rapid increases in their distribution costs since 2013.\n\nThe report recommends that the South Australian Government take action to:\n\nUndertake an urgent review of electricity retail regulation\n\nUndertake an urgent review of the existing regulation of distribution charges\n\nExamine mechanisms to enable local distribution networks to invest in assets that improve reliability for customers, and facilitate the integration of renewable energy into the network\n\nThe report also recommends that the Australian Energy Regulator should seek to work with industry to seek additional reforms to be considered by the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC).\n\nThe report is open for submissions and can be found here.\n\nMore information on how energy networks operate and cost can be found here.\n\nSee our website for further information on energy and power regulation.
