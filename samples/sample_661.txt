by Scott Selwood\n\nWith all the excitement of the season opener against the L.A. Chargers, it can be easy to forget about the rest of the AFC West. The division could be one of the most competitive in the NFL this season. The Chargers have been one of the more competitive teams for the past decade, the Chiefs and Raiders have shown that they have talent on their teams and the Broncos should still be one of the best teams in the league.\n\nBut with all that said, here are my predictions for the AFC West this season.\n\nDenver Broncos (11-5)\n\nThe Broncos are the defending Super Bowl Champions, so they have that going for them. They also return almost all of the players who made them a top offense and defense. Case Keenum is back and while he had a fantastic season last year, he is a streaky quarterback and can have some cold spells.\n\nThe Broncos have a tough schedule and some injuries can make this team vulnerable. But, it should be enough to get them to the playoffs and potentially another Super Bowl appearance.\n\nKansas City Chiefs (10-6)\n\nThe Chiefs are the team in the division with the most questions. After losing several defensive stars to free agency, the defense is going to have to improve. The offense is lead by an explosive group of skill position players, but the defense could still be a liability.\n\nThe Chiefs play a tough schedule this season, so the defense will have to show improvement. If the Chiefs have a down year, the Chargers will be there to take the division.\n\nOakland Raiders (9-7)\n\nThe Raiders had a huge turnaround last season after going from a team with little hope to a team with some momentum. They have an explosive offense and a good defense. However, they still have some of the same problems they’ve had the past few years.\n\nThey still have issues protecting Derek Carr. Carr can make the big plays to score, but if the offensive line doesn’t improve, the Raiders could see themselves under .500. The Raiders have the potential to be one of the best teams in the league, but I think they will have another so-so year.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (8-8)\n\nThe Chargers will be good this year. The problem is, it won’t be enough. While the Chargers have an improved offense and a good defense, they have some tough losses in the division. The Chargers also play a tough schedule, which will lead to some tough games.\n\nThe Chargers have the potential to make some noise this year, but they will have to take a few wins from the Chiefs and Raiders.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\n
