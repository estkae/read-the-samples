Robert Del Tredici's poem "Who Killed Cock Robin?" is about a dying bird that asks his friends who killed him. Every time he asks, his friends respond by saying they did not. After the second time he asks the question, the bird asks "Who saw?" and his friends answer that they did not see either. Then, after the bird asks "Who will cry?", the friends respond that they will not cry either. At the end of the poem, the bird asks "Who will be my Valentine?" His friends answer "I," and they all fall down dead. This poem demonstrates the dangers of telling lies.
