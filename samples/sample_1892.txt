Haplogroup K2 (Y-DNA)\n\nHaplogroup K2 is a human Y-DNA haplogroup. It is one of two branches of the more ancestral Haplogroup K, and as such, it is a descendant of Haplogroup K1.\n\nK-M526 is the designation of the mutation that defines this branch. It was discovered in a population living near Lake Tana in Ethiopia in 2008.\n\nThis phylogenetic tree of haplogroup K2 subclades is based on the paper by Mannis van Oven and Manfred Kayser "Updated comprehensive phylogenetic tree of global human mitochondrial DNA variation" and subsequent published research.\n\n\nK2a1b is found in India.
