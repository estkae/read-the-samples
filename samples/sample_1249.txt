"How to Give Your Ball Python a Bath\n\nBy Jeff Ronne\n\nWhether your snake has been in hibernation for a while, or you've had him for a long time and he's gotten a little rank, you'll want to give your snake a bath. Bathing your snake is relatively easy, but it is a delicate process that you should take your time with.\n\nStep 1\n\nMix warm water with a bit of vanilla in it. Put the water in a small bucket and test it on the inside of your elbow to make sure it's not too hot. Put the snake in the bucket.\n\nStep 2\n\nGently run a washcloth through your snake's body. Go through every crevice you can. After you've done that, take a very soft toothbrush (soft, not hard) and scrub his scales. Scrub hard, but be gentle.\n\nStep 3\n\nPut your snake back in the water. If you have a separate feeding tub, fill it with water and place it next to the water. You can then put your snake in there to eat after he is all done.\n\nStep 4\n\nLeave the snake in the bath until he stops moving around.\n\nStep 5\n\nLet the snake dry by putting him back in the enclosure he came from or in a box for a while. Make sure the enclosure he is placed in has enough ventilation.
