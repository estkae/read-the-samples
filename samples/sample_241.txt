Just when you thought the internet couldn't get any stranger, along comes this clip of a goat using a GoPro camera to take selfies with his friends.\n\nFor this clip, viral video company Barely Political collaborated with the animals at Old MacDonald's Farm Sanctuary in California, who treated the GoPro to an adventure, doing a spot of fishing, swimming and lying on the grass.\n\nIt is unclear exactly what the point of the video is, except to showcase goats that have some level of intelligence.
