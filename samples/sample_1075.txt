USS Tourmaline (PYc-11)\n\nUSS "Tourmaline" (PYc-11), later PY-10, was a patrol yacht in commission in the United States Navy from 1942 to 1946.\n\n"Tourmaline" was built as a civilian motor yacht in 1930 by the Bath Iron Works Corporation at Bath, Maine, for a Mr. Watson of Washington, D.C. The U.S. Navy acquired her on 16 April 1942 for use as a patrol yacht during World War II. She was commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard in Boston, Massachusetts, on 30 April 1942 as USS "Tourmaline" (PYc-11).\n\n"Tourmaline" departed Boston on 14 May 1942 for Casco Bay, Maine, for shakedown training. She then proceeded to New York City, New York, and there reported to Commander, East Coast Patrol, for duty. On 6 June 1942 she got underway for her first wartime patrol, operating out of Argentia, Newfoundland, in the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\n"Tourmaline" returned to Boston, Massachusetts, on 4 July 1942. From then through 1944, with the exception of a two-month period in 1943, she made regular, extended patrols in the North Atlantic out of Argentia. On 2 July 1944, while operating out of Argentia in waters off the coast of Greenland, she rescued the crew of a Navy PBM Mariner that had gone down during an anti-submarine patrol. On 25 October 1944 she went to the aid of the Army transport USAT "Logan Victory" which had been torpedoed and was sinking in the North Atlantic, ultimately rescuing 77 survivors.\n\nOn 2 March 1945 "Tourmaline" was redesignated PY-10. On 10 June 1945 she departed Argentia for her last wartime patrol. Following her return to the United States she was decommissioned at the Portsmouth Navy Yard at Kittery, Maine, on 15 September 1946. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 11 October 1946, and she was sold to "Patapsco Scrap Co., Inc." on 15 May 1947.\n\n
