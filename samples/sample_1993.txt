What is a metaphor? Metaphors are a type of literary device where a thing or idea is referred to by a word or phrase that is symbolic of another thing or idea. They can be used for emphasis, or simply to give readers a clearer understanding of what the writer is trying to convey. For example:\n\nWearing glasses was not a metaphor for her seeing eye. The eye test meant that she was legally allowed to drive without any restrictions.\n\nIn this example, the phrase "not a metaphor for her seeing eye" is used to clarify that the previous statement ("Wearing glasses was a metaphor for her seeing eye") was not actually a metaphor.\n\nThere are many types of metaphors:\n\nDirect Metaphors - These are the most common types of metaphors, which directly compare two or more items or ideas. For example: "Wearing glasses was not a metaphor for her seeing eye."\n\nConcealed Metaphors - In these types of metaphors, the word or phrase being used as a metaphor is hidden in the sentence. For example: "Jack was having an awful day. His teacher was a dunce, his math homework was harder than it should be, his lunch was completely inedible, and he was sure that he had gotten a cavity after eating a particularly hard-bitten caramel." In this example, the words "was having" and "was" are being used to give a more detailed explanation of what happened, but they are also being used to describe a day as being "awful" and a teacher as being "dunce".\n\nDichotomy - This type of metaphor compares two different, usually opposite, things or ideas in order to emphasize how different they are. For example: "When it comes to desserts, I'm as tough as nails, but when it comes to paper cuts, I'm as soft as an open wound."\n\nOther types of metaphors - There are many other types of metaphors, and some can be hard to recognize. For example:
