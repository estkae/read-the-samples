Friedrich Hofmeister\n\nFriedrich Hofmeister was a German piano and music publisher in Leipzig. His company, Friedrich Hofmeister Musikverlag, is the oldest music publishing company in Germany and one of the oldest in the world. It was founded in 1798. His catalogue contained more than 25,000 works, many published as composers' copies, without printed music.\n\nHofmeister was a friend and patron of Robert Schumann, a composer whose music was frequently published by Hofmeister, and a generous supporter of Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy. A close friendship developed between Mendelssohn and Schumann, who lived at the same time.\n\nOne of the most important works of Schumann, his Piano Quintet in E-flat major, op. 44, is dedicated to Friedrich Hofmeister, as is Schumann's Piano Concerto in A minor, op. 54.\n\nIn his will, Schumann left his house to Mendelssohn.\n\nIn 2011, a new edition of the full catalogue was launched. The company today is a subsidiary of the German publisher BÃ¤renreiter, founded in 1525.\n
