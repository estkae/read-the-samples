Title: Remember Me?\n\nAuthor: mistymidnight\n\nSummary: Buffy's getting all those amazing visions she got in the Mayor's office, only they're getting more specific… Now if only she could remember how to use them.\n\nRating: T\n\nDisclaimer: The characters you recognize are the property of Joss Whedon, Mutant Enemy, and various networks. The rest are mine.\n\nFeedback: Please. Good or bad, I'd like to hear it.\n\n"So what's the plan?"\n\n"I don't know."\n\nBuffy lowered her hand from her face. She and Xander were sitting in his car. She'd just come back from the doctor. She thought that she was finally remembering how to act like a normal human being. She thought that she was finally remembering how to feel like a normal human being.\n\nXander touched her shoulder. "What did the doctor say?"\n\n"Nothing." Buffy shrugged. "They didn't do a thing. They were just doing a routine check-up."\n\n"Checking up on you, huh?"\n\nBuffy frowned. "What's that supposed to mean?"\n\n"Nothing."\n\n"No, come on, Xander. Say what you want to say. This is why I don't like talking to you."\n\nXander flinched and started the car. "Sorry. It's nothing."\n\n"What do you think they're really doing? Do you think they're trying to find a way to get Spike and Dru out of my head?"\n\n"I doubt it." Xander's voice was soft. "I think they just want to see if your brain's still in there."\n\nBuffy winced. She hated when he put it that way. But Xander was right. They didn't want her here. She knew they didn't want her here. Why else would they do this? Why else would they make her go through the routine that every other person with brain damage goes through?\n\nBuffy reached over and turned on the radio. She turned it up, blocking out Xander's annoying voice.\n\nThey didn't want her here. They didn't care about her. It was all just a game.\n\nXander sighed. He was glad Buffy was back. He was so glad she was back. But he still couldn't help feeling bad for her. He couldn't help but worry about what would happen to her when this was all over. He couldn't help but wonder if he would be able to stop himself from hurting her when this was all over.\n\nHe drove around aimlessly. "Do you want to talk about it?"\n\n"About what?" Buffy asked absently.\n\n"About what's bothering you."\n\nBuffy sighed. "Why does something have to be bothering me?"\n\nXander smiled. "You're Buffy. I know you better than you know yourself."\n\n"Oh." Buffy thought about that for a moment. It was true, she supposed. She was Buffy, and Xander was right. She couldn't remember everything about her old life, but she remembered Xander. She remembered him more than anyone else. "So what is it? I mean, you're not usually this…chummy with me."\n\n"I was worried about you."\n\n"No, I mean…" Buffy shook her head. "You know what I mean. It's about what I said at the hospital, isn't it? You think I should leave Sunnydale, right?"\n\n"What?" Xander was taken aback. "No! Of course not!"\n\n"Xander, I'm not even really here."\n\n"So? That doesn't matter. You still live here. I still live here."\n\n"And what happens when I don't anymore? When I leave and you're left behind?"\n\nXander turned the car. "This is what I've been trying to tell you. I'm not leaving."\n\n"Yes, you are."\n\n"No, I'm not."\n\n"Yes, you are. You said it yourself. I'm not even really here."\n\n"Buffy, you are here." Xander pulled into the parking lot of the Magic Box. He shut the engine off and turned to her. "You've always been here."\n\n"No, I haven't." Buffy shook her head. "I was lost. But I'm here now. And I don't think I'm going to stay here for very long."\n\n"Why?" Xander asked.\n\n"Because…" Buffy swallowed. "Because I don't think I belong here."\n\nXander frowned. "You're Buffy. Of course you belong here."\n\n"I'm not Buffy." Buffy tried to get out of the car, but Xander grabbed her wrist. "Let go of me, Xander."\n\n"I'm not going to let you go. You're in no condition to go anywhere."\n\n"What makes you think that? I'm not in a wheelchair, I'm not using a cane. I'm just a little slow."\n\n"That's the thing, Buffy. You're not slow. You're not even there."\n\n"Xander, what are you talking about?"\n\nXander sighed. "Buffy, when you were in the hospital, did you remember anything?"\n\n"Of course I did. The whole time."\n\n"You didn't, Buffy. You couldn't. You had no memory."\n\n"Then how could I have remembered anything?"\n\n"Because your mind is slowly coming back to you." Xander glanced at the front door of the Magic Box. "It's starting to come back to you. And you're going to have to leave."\n\n"So what if I do? What's wrong with that?"\n\n"Nothing. Except that I don't want you to go."\n\n"And you"
