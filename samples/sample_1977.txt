Well, for the past few weeks I have been testing out the new IntelliScreenX 3 and a few other cool tweaks from SBSettings, ColorFlow and LockInfo. First, let me just start out by saying IntelliScreenX 3 is NOT out yet, so these results are from the 3.0 beta that just recently hit Cydia.\n\nIf you are not familiar with IntelliScreenX, it is a tweak that does a lot. In fact, it’s description says it all:\n\nIntelliScreenX™ is an iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad information app designed to replace the functionality of the “notch”, or status bar, located at the top of iOS devices. The ultimate goal is to provide users with a new way to view essential information in an attractive and unobtrusive way.\n\nThe tweak does everything from adding features like current weather conditions and news to displaying your upcoming calendar events, missed phone calls and even text messages right in the Notification Center.\n\nThe latest version, IntelliScreenX 3, looks amazing. I can’t say enough how well it looks. It adds some more customizations such as adding the battery percentage in the Notification Center as well as some really cool transition animations that you can choose from. These animations include:\n\nBlending (default)\n\nBlending & Pull Down\n\nVertical\n\nFade\n\nPull Down & Blend\n\nThe downside to IntelliScreenX 3 is that there is no way to add the IntelliScreenX 3 preferences panel. This is because it is no longer an actual preference panel but now an actual “app”. You can choose to not install this, however it adds some really cool features that you cannot disable such as the weather conditions.\n\nHowever, if you do decide to install it you will get a new application on your SpringBoard called IntelliScreen. If you double-tap this application, it will load up the IntelliScreenX 3 preferences panel.\n\nNow that you are familiar with the tweak, here are my results:\n\nTesting IntelliScreenX 3\n\nI really like this tweak. I have been using it for a few weeks now and it has been really stable for me. I did have one issue in that when the tweak first came out, it would crash when it was loading in the Notification Center.\n\nBut it appears that this was only in the beta. Once it was released to Cydia, it has been working very well. However, I did notice one thing about it when it was first released.\n\nI’m sure that it’s just something that is probably minor, but it’s still worth mentioning. There are times when the weather conditions are displayed in the Notification Center and they are all screwed up. For example, instead of displaying the actual current weather conditions, it will display things like the forecasted conditions or simply show “Unknown”.\n\nAnother thing that I noticed is that the weather forecast is not extremely accurate. For example, I noticed that it says that it will be raining in my area when it’s actually dry as can be outside.\n\nAnother thing that I didn’t like about this tweak is that it adds a tiny advertisement in the top-left corner of the Notification Center when it loads. To me, that is really annoying, but this is only in the beta version and not in the release version. I’m sure the final version will be just as good as the first.\n\nOverall, I really like this tweak. I do wish that the weather forecast was a little bit more accurate, but this is only in the beta version. I’m sure once the final release hits Cydia it will be perfect. If you are a Notification Center addict like me, you should definitely get this tweak.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?
