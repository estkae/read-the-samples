â€œ\n\nI have no hesitation in recommending you to the body of workers in Australia, either in Railway or Country Tramways, or Electrical construction. Your outfit has been constantly at work for nearly three years and has been found fully to justify my own and your own high recommendation of it, both for its efficiency and economy of working. The Cableways I have had in operation for two years are found to work in the most satisfactory manner, both in operation and maintenance, in fact I do not know of any system that I would prefer for tramways, and I am glad that I have them.\n\nJ.R.
