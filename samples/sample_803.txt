A new report claims that health insurance premiums will skyrocket for millions of Americans if the Senate's version of Trumpcare becomes law.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) plans to call a vote on the Better Care Reconciliation Act this week, despite the fact that the bill remains a secret to everyone except a small group of GOP senators who have been allowed to view it in a private room on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn a new report, the Center for American Progress (CAP) estimates that the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan on the individual insurance market would rise an average of 34 percent under the GOP bill. In Arizona, for example, the monthly premium for a 27-year-old purchasing a silver plan would go from $208 a month under the Affordable Care Act to $277.41 under the Senate's version of Trumpcare.\n\nAccording to CAP, the "modest" subsidies included in the bill — ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 — would do little to protect Americans from soaring premiums. They note that the $2,000 subsidy would cover just a quarter of the premium cost for the average individual with an annual income of $28,000, leaving the individual on the hook for $6,500.\n\n"Subsidies in the Senate bill are woefully inadequate for low- and middle-income Americans, and actually leave many people with higher costs and worse coverage," said Judith Solomon, vice president for health policy at CAP, and a former top official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Obama.\n\nTrumpcare is intended to lower premiums for younger, healthier Americans by slashing Medicaid, eliminating subsidies for insurance purchased on the individual market, and allowing insurers to charge older customers more for coverage.\n\nBut while premiums for young people may decrease, they are likely to go up substantially for older people, according to a report by the Congressional Budget Office released on Monday.\n\n"Older people are going to have to pay a heck of a lot more," an anonymous insurance industry source told Axios. "I don't think the math works."
