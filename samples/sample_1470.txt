Can you picture the scene?\n\nThe Pyramids in Giza, Egypt. Nightfall. Sand swept desert all around, a few camels off in the distance. Suddenly, out of the darkness a camel pulls up next to yours, an ancient mummy on it, smiling knowingly, and a voice booms:\n\n"HIYO SILVER!"\n\nThat's the experience of reading the phenomenal prose of these genius writers. It's clear that they do not have an editor to tinker with their wonderful work. There are certainly mistakes, not to mention outright errors and failures of continuity, but it's just so good I can't help but love it.\n\n1. To Live by Yu Hua\n\nMy own favourite of the year. To Live, or Huozhe, as it's known in China, is the modern-day story of a girl who grows up in the shadow of the Cultural Revolution in China in the 1960s and 70s. It is a novel full of vivid and often disturbing imagery, with characters so well developed that they seem like living, breathing people. This is a book about life in China, and is both engrossing and thought provoking. If I'm not mistaken, this is the first translated work by Yu Hua to be published in English. It is long, at more than 600 pages, but I would have read it twice if I had the time.\n\n2. The Dwarf by Miguel de Cervantes\n\nThe oldest book on this list, The Dwarf, published in 1604, is the second part of a trilogy. It is another book I have not finished, but which I am still going through at the moment. I could list everything that is wrong with the book: the lack of coherence in the story, the pointless subplots and characters, the cliched dialogue, but despite all this I still find it so entertaining, so fascinating that I can't help but carry on reading.\n\n3. The Last Empire: The Final Days of the Soviet Union by Serhii Plokhy\n\nPlokhy's book is part of a genre which has sprung up in the past ten years or so. It tells the history of the Soviet Union from the end of World War Two up to its final days in 1991, with chapters written by a number of different authors, a series of different views on the same events. In particular, I loved the chapter about Leonid Brezhnev, which put the bloated face I associate with Soviet leaders into the context of the times, so that I could see him as a human being rather than a caricature.\n\n4. James Bond: Casino Royale by Ian Fleming\n\nI have seen every film in the Bond series, and I have read every one of Ian Fleming's Bond novels, including the three which have been published posthumously. I didn't like them, though, and Casino Royale, first published in 1953, is the best of them. But not the most enjoyable. I can't help it. I love Bond, and the villains, and the gadgets, and the violence, but this is a book about a man who wakes up one day and decides to become a spy. It's hard to take seriously.\n\n5. Schuld und Verh√§ngnis by Erich Maria Remarque\n\nI am yet to finish this. Or start it. The translation of this novel, in the original German, is called "Guilt and Destiny", and I am holding out for that. I am already struggling to get through it, and I am yet to start the first chapter. But I will, at some point, and I am sure it will be worth it.\n\n6. Silent Souls by Guillermo Martinez\n\nA thriller, or a novel of ideas, about life, death and the nature of evil. I couldn't tell you what it is about, but I liked it. I think. I read it about a year ago, in one sitting, and have forgotten most of it. But the thought of a book which I can't remember which may or may not have been any good, but which I want to read again, has to make it on the list, right?\n\n7. When God Was a Rabbit by Sarah Winman\n\nThis novel is set in England in the 1990s, when life was completely different. It is the story of a girl, Florence, and her relationships with her family, as well as her relationship with her sister. I loved it.\n\n8. Ego by Ben Okri\n\nI am still reading this one. Or I was until I picked up the next one on the list. But it's good. A very good writer, I reckon.\n\n9. The End of Alice by A.M. Homes\n\nThis one is very dark, and it is about a man who kidnaps, and then tortures and kills, a little girl. That's it. It's shocking, but not for that reason. It's a novel about life, in a very different way to When God Was a Rabbit, but very good.\n\n10. Eat My Dust by Amy Ephron\n\nEphron's novel is like a cross between Trainspotting and Bridget Jones's Diary. It is the story of a group of losers, as they grow up together in New York in the 1980s and early 90s, and it is full of wonderful humour and vivid descriptions. A great, great read.\n\nIt would have been very easy to fill the list with books I enjoyed, but there were a few, like Crime and Punishment and Catch-22, which I enjoyed, but did not like. They are great, but I didn't have as much fun reading them as I did the rest of this list. Maybe I'll do a best of the worst in the coming days.\n\nBut these ten were the best, most fun books I have read in the last twelve months. They have made me laugh and cry, and, in some cases, want to write my own.\n\nHappy reading!
