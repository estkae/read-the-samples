By Dick's Politics\n\nPresident Barack Obama’s deficit reduction committee voted on November 23 to cut Social Security benefits for the most vulnerable seniors and slash benefits to children of people who have worked in covered jobs, while increasing Medicare premiums and co-pays.\n\nThe bi-partisan group made its recommendations to Obama in a letter on November 23. The group’s plan will be the basis for the debt ceiling “grand bargain” that the White House and Congressional Republicans have been negotiating.\n\nThe co-chairs of the committee, Sen. Erskine Bowles (D-NC) and former Sen. Alan Simpson (R-WY), recommended cuts of up to 15 percent in Social Security and other entitlement programs as part of the group’s plan to reduce deficits by $4 trillion over ten years.\n\nIn exchange, Bowles and Simpson recommended raising the eligibility age for Social Security from 67 to 69, increasing Social Security taxes for higher-wage earners, and means-testing Social Security benefits.\n\nSimpson is a close friend of the oil billionaire Koch brothers, who bankroll numerous Tea Party groups.\n\nThe other nine members of the bipartisan committee who endorsed the group’s report were Sens. John Kerry (D-MA), Rob Portman (R-OH), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Kent Conrad (D-ND), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Mark Warner (D-VA), Alice Rivlin (D-DC), and James M.Rubio (R-FL).\n\nThe Bowles-Simpson plan includes additional recommendations, such as:\n\nA cut of 5 percent in the annual cost-of-living adjustment, which would reduce future benefits by about $3.5 trillion;\n\nA cut of $500 billion in annual Social Security benefits, which would lower the average benefit from $16,000 to about $14,000 a year;\n\nReducing Social Security cost-of-living adjustments for those with incomes over $85,000, with the highest income earners receiving no benefit increases, while those with lower incomes receiving no reductions;\n\nIncreasing Medicare premiums and co-pays for seniors by $500 billion; and\n\nA freeze on the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security, disability benefits, and veterans’ benefits.\n\nBowles and Simpson’s proposal also reduces the value of annual cost-of-living adjustments by $112 billion and increases the amount of income subject to the Social Security payroll tax by $128 billion, in order to cut $200 billion from the program.\n\nThe bi-partisan committee also endorsed cutting Medicare payments to providers, which would reduce provider reimbursements by 5 percent, along with requiring hospitals and other providers to share in the cost of health care quality improvements, which would save an additional $5.4 billion.\n\nThe committee also recommended increasing the premium for Medicare Part B by 15 percent.\n\nAmong its other recommendations are $600 billion in reductions to the federal workforce and another $600 billion in cuts to the military, but it does not specify where those cuts would come from.\n\nInstead, it says, “This recommendation does not specify where those cuts should be taken. We look forward to working with the administration, as well as the House and Senate, to develop these reductions.”\n\nOn November 23, the White House said it would incorporate the Bowles-Simpson report in its proposal to raise the debt ceiling.\n\n“We think the framework that the fiscal commission laid out is a very sensible one, and will serve as a basis for the White House as we look at the various proposals,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said. “It’s important to emphasize the progress that has been made on the commissions report.”\n\nHowever, Carney said he did not believe the report would be a sufficient basis for the White House’s negotiations with Congressional Republicans, which are still under way.\n\n“I don’t believe the commission report has sufficient votes to pass the Congress at this point,” Carney said. “But that doesn’t mean that it can’t, and that it shouldn’t, serve as a starting point for the President as he enters into negotiations with the Republican Party.”\n\nThe Bowles-Simpson report also recommends reducing the cost of Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program by $270 billion, cutting Medicare subsidies to private insurance companies by $70 billion, reducing subsidies to federal employee health care by $110 billion, and cutting federal civilian and military retirement costs by $150 billion.\n\nThe nine Democratic and Republican committee members also recommended cutting a total of $500 billion in non-defense discretionary spending.\n\nThe"
