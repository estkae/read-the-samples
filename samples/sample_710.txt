"I love snuggling up in bed in the winter with a good book. I love reading to my daughter and building the world of literature through her eyes. I also like to read to my daughter just because I want to!\n\nSo this year I am making a new tradition of a Mother Daughter Book Club with my daughter. We’ve been going over to the library together to pick out new books. It’s fun to pick out books together, to discuss what we like and don’t like about each book, and to start our own book collection.\n\nNow I’m off to read The Very Hungry Caterpillar with her. You know what we’ll do next? We’ll take a peek at our little butterfly book to see if it’s a boy or a girl butterfly. :)\n\nWhat are your favorite books to read with your little one?
