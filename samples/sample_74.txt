The motor is a very desirable 351 V8 and is equipped with a nice sounding Holley 650 carburetor. It runs well and has plenty of power. The trans is an automatic C4 and shifts smooth. This Ford is in great shape, the only exterior rust that I could see was on the door bottoms and they are easy to replace. Interior is in very nice shape, new headliner, new seats, new carpet and a nice newer steering wheel. It has power brakes, power steering, air conditioning and power top. These cars are extremely rare to find in this condition and price. If your looking for a car that is cool and nice to drive then this is it.
