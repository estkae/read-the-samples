Book Review: Afterworlds by Scott Westerfeld\n\nEven though this book came out in September, I am only just getting around to reading it. I’ve been so swamped with work and in a slump with my writing that it’s hard to get around to reading books that I actually enjoy.\n\nScott Westerfeld is known for writing the Uglies and the Leviathan series, both of which I’ve read and enjoyed. Afterworlds is a bit different from those books, as this book is written in dual narrative form. We have a beginning novelist (Darcy) and an unpublished writer (Lea) whose stories intertwine and overlap.\n\nI’ll be honest: the start of this book is really rough. I found the first 200 pages to be repetitive and boring, as Darcy goes over her writing process and the book that she is writing while also being a teen with typical teen problems. As I got further into the book, I was glad that I hadn’t put it down. Darcy’s book becomes so much more than her book, but it’s Lea’s story that keeps you coming back to find out what’s going to happen to both of them.\n\nThere are also flashbacks to Darcy’s early childhood that I found quite interesting and thought that it added a new depth to the story. While reading this book, I didn’t want to put it down, even if I wasn’t always the biggest fan of the writing.\n\nOverall, I give this book a four out of five. If you are a fan of Uglies or Leviathan, this book will be a must read. For people who don’t know Westerfeld or want"
