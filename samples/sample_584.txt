"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are the next generation of royalty, but they have been married long enough that it’s possible to see some of the ways in which Meghan has begun to influence the royal family in her short time as a member of it. She has a busy schedule as a royal and still finds time to make the world a better place, and that includes doing her best to break down gender roles in the monarchy and challenge perceptions of what it means to be a royal bride.\n\n\n\nWhile she has been criticized by some for the way she dresses, she’s also done her part to change the way royal brides have traditionally looked in the past, as well as the types of charitable efforts they’ve participated in to promote their causes.\n\n\n\nMeghan’s influence is evident in the family as it adapts to the more progressive changes that she brings to the monarchy. She’s done everything from change her last name to start a new royal legacy and represent women’s right to equality, to giving a voice to the marginalized through her various charitable causes.\n\n\n\nIn the spirit of changing the royal narrative, let’s take a look at some of the ways Meghan has broken the mold as a royal bride, and what that means for the future of the monarchy.\n\n\n\n1. Using her platform to make a change\n\nMeghan’s position as the Duchess of Sussex gives her a unique platform that allows her to promote causes she cares about, from racial equality to gender equality to her favorite charities. She’s used that platform to make a difference for women and girls.\n\n\n\n2. Being the face of the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements\n\nShe was the first royal to speak out about the #MeToo movement, the backlash against women speaking out about sexual harassment and abuse, and what she calls the “heavy burden” of being a woman in the public eye. In a rare interview with the BBC, she spoke about how she’s always been aware of how sexism and racism have been barriers that she had to overcome, and that she is pleased to see the MeToo and Time’s Up movements making their mark on society and the public at large.\n\n\n\n3. Standing by her husband during the #MeToo movement\n\nShe made a conscious decision not to speak out about the backlash against her husband’s former girlfriends, like her rumored rival Meghan Markle, as she has refused to criticize other women. She doesn’t play the victim, but instead encourages women to speak out against abuse and fight for equality in every aspect of their lives.\n\n\n\n4. Becoming a philanthropist and charity ambassador\n\nShe’s been an ambassador for the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) since the beginning of 2018. She promotes their various projects, including the fight against the water crisis in East Africa, and the importance of providing women and children with safe drinking water and adequate sanitation services.\n\n\n\n5. The fashion choices she makes as a royal bride\n\nWhile Meghan is often criticized for her outfits and looks by members of the public, she’s broken a few rules and worn clothes that had never been worn by previous royal brides. She’s broken the tradition of a royal bride wearing all white by wearing a black pantsuit by Stella McCartney to her wedding. She’s also chosen a number of different designers for her wedding gowns, and has worn outfits that are a little more modern in their style.\n\n\n\n6. As a role model for women and girls\n\nMeghan has made it clear that she wants to use her influence to promote the idea that women and girls can do and be anything, including princesses. She’s spoken openly about the obstacles she faced as a biracial woman in America and has spoken about how her mother taught her to be strong, to never give up, and to push through any obstacles.\n\n\n\n7. Using her fame to help women in other countries\n\nShe’s spoken about how the public should be “mindful” of women in other countries when they’re giving out opinions and criticisms about women and their clothing. She wants to ensure that women from different cultures are able to make decisions for themselves about what they wear and how they present themselves to the world.\n\n\n\n8. Embracing and changing royal tradition\n\nShe’s already had two official residences as a royal wife, making it clear that she’s going to have her own role and position in the monarchy. She’s also kept her maiden name and made it clear that she won’t be taking the traditional route for royal brides by doing so. She’s already used her influence to change royal tradition and make it more inclusive for women, as well as to make her own path in the monarchy.\n\n\n\nIt’s clear that Meghan has made it her mission to challenge the perception of what it means to be a royal bride, and change the way that the monarchy interacts with the public. She’s already taken steps to set herself apart from other royal brides and has broken the mold in so many ways that future royal brides are sure to look to her as a role model.
