news, local-news,\n\nThe hunt is on for the missing SA-2 class cruiser submarine missing off the West Australian coast. But if it's anything like the last time the WA-based HMAS Stirling's "Seekers" unit was called to the southern Indian Ocean, it could be a lengthy, drawn-out and ultimately fruitless task. HMAS Stirling's Submarine Escape and Rescue Section was deployed in early November last year to aid the Australian Transport Safety Bureau and specialist United States salvage teams in their hunt for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. Despite an exhaustive air and sea search, the team failed to find any trace of the Boeing 777-200, which had disappeared on March 8, 2014 while on a routine flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The four-month search, the most expensive in aviation history, ended on January 29 with authorities ruling that the aircraft had crashed into the Indian Ocean, leaving all 239 people on board dead. Now, the same Stirling's unit is being tasked with finding the missing Russian K-152 Nerpa nuclear-powered attack submarine, which failed to resurface after being delivered to the Russian navy from a shipyard in the Arctic port of Severodvinsk on November 8. The Stirling's "Seekers" team, known formally as the HMAS Stirling Submarine Escape and Rescue Squadron, is part of the Royal Australian Navy's Clearance Diving Branch, which specialises in mine and torpedo disposal. According to a 2016 article on the Stirling's Clearance Diving Branch website, the unit's work includes: Routine submarine escape and rescue;\n\nMine and torpedo disposal;\n\nAssistance with other nations' submarines in Australian waters;\n\nEgress training and support for nuclear submarines operating in Australia; and\n\nLocating and recovering "lost" submarines.\n\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/storypad-3A3v2prgbxqZzKYFb2WvZD6/c74b44f5-c676-4425-a2a7-3dcf9645cd37.jpg/r3_0_1257_720_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\n\nNerpa, missing Russian sub, search begins facebook SHARE\n\ntwitter TWEET\n\nemail\n\nwhatsapp
