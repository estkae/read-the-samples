Justin Fox\n\nIf you are the type of person who needs a car that can turn on a dime in the city but also tow your boat to the lake, the 2014 Lexus ES will probably fit the bill. When Lexus first introduced the current ES in 2006, the formula was right. But by 2012, it had become dated. The original ES was slow, thirsty and not very capable. The second generation added power and speed and was the first ES to tow. With the third generation, Lexus has taken that formula one step further and brought in all-wheel drive and a more refined driving experience. But it also kept the old formula.\n\nStyling\n\nThe 2014 Lexus ES shares its looks with the outgoing model and in a way with the new IS sedans as well. So it is a blend of a wedge shape and something more traditional. From some angles, it is vaguely reminiscent of the LFA. Its grille is pronounced, its side character lines are muscular and its curves on the hood and trunk are attractive and not overdone.\n\nIts front end is more Lexus-like than before and its tail is more sedan-like than before. It has a more modern look without being overly aggressive and its design is not overly bland like some of its competitors. It is a good looking sedan but it will be a little too plain for some people.\n\nTruck Trend's 2014 Best Interiors trophy went to the new Lexus ES. It has an attractive dash that has been borrowed from other Lexus models but it is still nice and functional.\n\nTechnology\n\nI was surprised at how good the 2014 ES was. It was comfortable and quick and the transmission was a work of art. It was easy"
