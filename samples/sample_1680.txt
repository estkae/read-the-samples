SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea will get access to some of Japan's military communications networks, easing a longtime source of bilateral tension, as part of a broader deal aimed at defusing the row over "comfort women", Japanese and South Korean officials said.\n\nA deal on military intelligence sharing would give South Korea a greater role in monitoring any future North Korean military action, amid joint efforts to try to persuade the North to abandon its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nSouth Korea will also get access to a Japanese military communications database, the officials said, as part of an agreement due to be announced during Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit to Seoul on Friday.\n\nAbe will visit the South to hold talks with President Park Geun-hye at the start of his two-day trip to South Korea, as he tries to lay to rest the festering row over Japan's wartime past.\n\nUnder the agreement, the two countries will set up a new information-sharing mechanism on defense, they said.\n\n"A new deal to share military intelligence will be announced," a South Korean government official said, adding that Seoul had been pushing for such a deal since North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test in January.\n\n"The deal will allow South Korea to better monitor any new North Korean missile activities. We will have an upper hand in predicting and analyzing the North Korean military activities," the official said.\n\nPark's office declined to comment.\n\nJapanese officials said the two countries will establish an information sharing system that is more advanced than those already in place between Tokyo and Washington, or Tokyo and Seoul.\n\nThis system would involve intelligence gathered from reconnaissance activities, military exercises and analysis of data from defense and military satellites, they said.\n\n"South Korea and Japan will share more information than they did in the past, and the South Korean military will get direct access to Japan's military communications network," one Japanese official said.\n\nSouth Korean officials said the military communications network could allow them to send warning messages to their troops faster than at present.\n\nSouth Korea's defense ministry spokesman, Moon Sang-gyun, declined to confirm the reports, saying details of the agreement were not yet known.\n\nJapan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said a deal on sharing military intelligence had been "nearly finalized".\n\nIn 2013, South Korea complained about a possible secret deal between Japan and the United States that would have allowed Japanese forces to use U.S. bases on South Korean soil in the event of a crisis on the Korean peninsula.\n\nSouth Korean officials later said that a direct intelligence sharing deal with Japan could also be part of any such pact between Washington and Tokyo.\n\nIn a recent sign of improving relations between the two Asian neighbors, Japan and South Korea last week agreed to resolve the issue of "comfort women" - a Japanese euphemism for girls and women, many of them Korean, forced to work in its wartime brothels.\n\nAbe will hold talks with Park, Japanese media said, but it was unclear if he will go to a controversial shrine that honors war criminals among Japan's war dead.\n\nA visit by Abe would be certain to anger China and South Korea.\n\nIn 2012, Park ordered Abe to stay away from the shrine, which is seen in Asia as a symbol of Japan's past militarism.\n\nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (C) delivers a speech at the foreign correspondents' club in Tokyo, Japan, December 15, 2015.
