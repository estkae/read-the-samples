American archaeologists have found what they say is the oldest known solar eclipse in history.\n\nThe eclipse, which occurred between 3375 and 2818 BCE, was observed by Stone Age man on an island in the South Pacific Ocean.\n\nArchaeologists from the University of Queensland found the evidence for the ancient eclipse on an island in the Solomon Islands.\n\nThe island, known as Weta, has been uninhabited for the last 700 years and scientists have found a series of fish traps, or tide pools, on the island that were used by a pre-historic civilisation.\n\nProfessor David Deniger and colleagues have also found large numbers of smashed and discarded stone axes that the inhabitants of the island would have used to hack down trees to make the fish traps.\n\nWhile investigating the island, they found that there were much larger piles of discarded axes at certain locations than others.\n\nThese locations all happened to be around the high-tide mark, suggesting that the axes were used in the construction of fish traps, which involved blocking the path of the tide at certain points to form small, shallow pools.\n\nHowever, further investigation of the large piles of axes, as well as an analysis of the rocky landscape, led the researchers to conclude that the axes had actually been used to carve out the fish traps when a sudden eclipse caused the tide to go out.\n\nThe sudden darkness caused the fish in the shallow pools to become trapped in the tidal pools, which the islanders could then easily scoop up and use as food.\n\nThe eclipse is thought to have been caused by a volcanic eruption on the island of Vanuatu, which sits just to the north of the Solomons.\n\nProfessor Deniger told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: "We believe that the volcanic ash, the ash plume, actually caused the air above the Solomon Islands to drop in temperature, thus making it dark."\n\nThe study, which has been published in the journal American Antiquity, suggests that the civilisation living on the island of Weta was able to plan ahead for the future, and used large numbers of the axes to make fish traps in advance, knowing that a solar eclipse was on the way.\n\nThe archaeologists found evidence for only one eclipse, which happened around 3375 BCE, but say that the people may have observed others in the future.
