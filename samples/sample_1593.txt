Washington: President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he had asked the US attorney general to look into whether the FBI surveilled his campaign and whether any calls he made were intercepted.\n\n“I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!" Trump tweeted.\n\nI hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 20, 2018\n\nTrump’s tweet follows a New York Times report on Wednesday that said the FBI had used an informant to contact members of his campaign team to investigate any links with Russia.\n\nTrump tweeted earlier on Thursday that it was the “all time biggest political scandal," and likened the actions of the Justice Department under former president Barack Obama to “Nixon/Watergate."\n\nIf the FBI or DOJ was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign, that is a really big deal. Only the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee (also, Senate Judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers. Drain the Swamp! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 19, 2018\n\nNow that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World, they should easily be able to take it into the Mid-Term Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party. Don’t worry about Dems FISA Abuse, missing Emails or Fraudulent Dossier! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 20, 2018\n\n....At what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 Witch Hunt, composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years, STOP! They have found no Collussion with Russia, No Obstruction, but they aren’t looking at the corruption... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 20, 2018\n\n...in the Hillary Clinton Campaign where she deleted 33,000 Emails, got $145,000,000 while Secretary of State, paid McCabes wife $700,000 (and got off the FBI hook along with Terry M) and so much more. Republicans and real Americans should start getting tough on this Scam. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 20, 2018\n\n“This is the all time biggest political scandal!" he tweeted. “The Obama FBI ‘SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBEDDED INFORMANT."\n\nThe White House did not immediately comment on Trump’s tweet.\n\nThe FBI opened its investigation into potential Russian meddling in the 2016 election last July, but so far has not provided evidence of collusion. Trump denies any collusion and calls the probe a “witch hunt."\n\nSo far, two former Trump aides have been charged with a crime. Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, and Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States and money laundering.\n\nOn Thursday, a federal judge in Washington ordered Manafort to be jailed after prosecutors accused him of tampering with witnesses.\n\nTrump has repeatedly called for an investigation into the Obama administration and accused the former president of trying to spy on him, without providing evidence.\n\nTrump’s critics have said that the investigation was prompted by a controversial research dossier put together by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele, paid for by Democrats, and that the FBI made every effort to investigate the information and determine its credibility.\n\nThe probe into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia has hounded the president for more than a year.
