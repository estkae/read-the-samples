Original Problem\n\nTwo integers x and y are given. The sum of the two is even. What is the largest possible value of x-y?\n\nExample\n\nGiven x = 1 and y = 2 we have x + y = 3. So the answer is x - y = -1.\n\nNote: This problem has appeared at several sites. The only known correct solution is in the book How to Solve It, by Polya. The problem is there posed as one of 1000 math problems, and Iâ€™m not sure about the original source of the problem.\n\nPrevious Solution\n\nJavaScript\n\nfunction largest(x, y) { if (x < 0 && y < 0) { throw new Error('x or y is negative'); } else if (x < y) { x = x - y; } else { y = y - x; } if (x == 0 || y == 0) { return x; } else { return largest(x, y - 1); } } largest(1, 2); // = -1 largest(-1, 1); // = -1 largest(1, -2); // = 1 largest(-1, -2); // = 1 largest(0, 0); // = 0 largest(2, -1); // = 2 largest(1, 1); // = 1\n\nCode\n\n/** * Given two integers x and y, compute the largest possible value of x - y * * @param {number} x The larger of"
