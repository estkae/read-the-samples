Growers running conventional greenhouses in New England should begin fertilizing their strawberry crops with the soil-test based Nutristart 10-6-26 product to ensure that soil pH and nutrient levels are correct.\n\nThat is the message of Cornell University plant nutrition specialist Michael Hartman.\n\nHartman, who spoke at a recent Maine Strawberry Growers Association meeting, recommends that growers test their soils this spring for pH, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium. These elements are essential for healthy plants and fruit.\n\nAccording to Hartman, nutrients in the soil should be available when the plants need them to achieve maximum production. “We also know from research that when we deliver these nutrients at a critical time, we’re going to get more berries and bigger berries,” Hartman told the MSGA.\n\nHe suggests that growers start adding Nutristart 10-6-26, a commercially formulated product that contains phosphates and potassium, to the crop when the temperature goes above 40 degrees F and the pH is 5.3 or lower.\n\nGrowers should begin by applying 1 to 1.5 pounds of Nutristart 10-6-26 per 100 square feet of bed, depending on the type of growing media, says Hartman.\n\nFor crops that don’t have a high pH at planting, such as flats or bare-root, growers should add Nutristart 10-6-26 as the plants start to grow and root.\n\n“You don’t want to add the Nutristart 10-6-26 to the soil at this time because it might be too much,” Hartman says. “You should add this when the pH of the bed is already down around 5.3 or lower, and when the plants are already growing.”\n\nThe Nutristart 10-6-26 product can be mixed with the soil and can be applied through overhead sprinklers or applied with a hand sprayer or dust applicator, he says.\n\nWhen making soil tests, growers should take several soil samples from several different parts of their crop to determine how the soil is behaving and to make sure that the same type of fertilizer is being applied throughout the crop.\n\nHartman says that growers can also use a soil probe or a soil auger to obtain a core of soil for testing. He says that a sampling of 4 inches down, or deeper, should be sufficient to test the soil’s pH.\n\n“If the plants are green, and you have a good root system, that’s an indication that the soil is in good shape,” Hartman says.\n\nThe Nutristart 10-6-26 product is available from local distributors. Hartman cautions that it is a chelated product, so it shouldn’t be applied during the heat of the day when it can be lost due to volatilization.\n\n“When you buy any kind of soil additive, especially chelated products, you need to be careful about application time,” Hartman says. “You can lose a good chunk of those chelated products if you apply them at the wrong time of day.”\n\nHartman’s presentation was part of the MSGA’s annual Spring Meeting at the University of Maine.\n\nHatch first started growing organic strawberries in his Leyden greenhouse in 1998. His interest in the challenges of organic growing started when he was just 5 years old, when his father first started growing strawberries commercially in western Massachusetts.\n\nDuring the past five years, Hatch has applied for and received a number of organic certifications for his greenhouses, including Organic Certification by the USDA and Organic Certification by the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association.\n\nFor more information about Hatch’s organic greenhouses, contact Hatch’s Organic at 693-5111 or visit www.hatchso.com.
