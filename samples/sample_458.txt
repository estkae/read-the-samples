A bi-partisan bill that would give states the option to spend welfare funding on faith-based charities is making its way through the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe legislation is called the Combating and Preventing Crimes of Violence Act, and it would give states the ability to use federal funds on programs that promote "the traditional values of marriage, family, religion, and morality." The bill would also authorize $5 million annually to states to promote chastity and healthy marriage.\n\nState governments would be permitted to use federal welfare funding to teach young people "the social, psychological, and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity," according to the text of the bill, which was introduced by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and 23 other co-sponsors.\n\nSen. Hatch said the legislation would reinforce "state efforts to strengthen families and communities by increasing opportunities for the social and economic advancement of young people."\n\nSen. Hatch's home state of Utah passed a similar law in 2013, and it was successfully implemented, according to a statement from the senator's office.\n\n"This is not an effort to allow taxpayer funding for religious groups, but to give states the option to partner with groups to promote healthy relationships," the senator's statement said.\n\nHowever, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) criticized the legislation as "misguided" and "misinformed," saying that it would restrict the freedom of organizations that provide critical services to women and children.\n\n"We have grave concerns about this bill because it's divisive, discriminatory, and fiscally irresponsible," Laura Murphy, director of ACLU's Washington Legislative Office, said in a statement. "It would allow states to use federal funds to provide child welfare services in a way that would exclude those who are not religious or who don't subscribe to traditional family values. This means that women and children who need assistance would be turned away, and those who provide critical services would be fired or not hired."\n\nThe bill, which was approved by the Senate Committee on Finance on Wednesday, now heads to the Senate floor.
