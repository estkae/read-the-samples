Another fabulous book that was recommended to me by the other half!\n\nHe has read every single one of G.A. McKevett’s books and this is the first one he read so it had a lot to live up to!\n\nAlthough this is a fantasy, it’s one of the few fantasy novels that I’ve read that doesn’t involve vampires, werewolves, fairies or anything else from the realms of fiction!\n\nThe Other Half says it’s the best fantasy novel he has read since Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time series. I would tend to agree as I found it a hard book to put down, which is rare these days when I have a million things I should be doing instead of reading!\n\nThe general premise of the book is that after a five thousand year old war is over, the winners decided to punish the losers by killing every last man, woman and child and then removing every trace of their existence, erasing them from history.\n\nThe losers, the Omotans, are considered to be not just defeated but almost evil, and so to keep them out of sight they were forced to hide their magical abilities and instead focus on developing their science.\n\nOne man decided he would rather be a freak in his own time than a hero in somebody else’s. This man is the greatest sorcerer in all of the Nine Kingdoms and also happens to be a total maniac.\n\nArriving back in our time, he has one purpose; to find all his descendents and kill them. His reasoning is that if they die in the future he will never be born in the past so he will never be able to go back and kill them!\n\nThis is where the fun begins…\n\nIf you like fantasy novels that are based in our world then you are in for a real treat.\n\nIt’s just as well I was given this book for Christmas as I would have been really pissed off to have had to wait months for the sequel, which was published last month.\n\nIt’s a real page turner, not a boring minute. It would be a great gift for anyone who enjoys reading fantasy but doesn’t want to be drowned in vampires and elves!
