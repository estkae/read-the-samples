"Racial profiling: It happens in America. Not just in the street. Not just in police cars and trains and buses. Not just in "The Jerk" and "Death Wish" and "Police Academy." It happens in the federal judiciary system, where judges have used every device at their disposal to arrest, convict, imprison and punish young African-American men.\n\nA new report by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, based on painstaking, voluminous research, quantifies the impact of this kind of race-based sentencing, showing that the racial disparity in federal drug prosecutions over the past 25 years has been massive. A young black man has been almost four times as likely as a young white man to be prosecuted in federal court for a drug offense.\n\n{snip}\n\nThe disparities were so great that during the 1990s, in all but a few of the federal judicial districts, the rate of prosecution of young black men for drug offenses actually exceeded the rate at which these men were committing drug crimes in their home communities. In some districts, the LDF report found, "if young black men were prosecuted at the same rate as young white men, drug possession prosecutions of young black men in those districts would drop by more than 50 percent."\n\nThe report focuses on prosecutions in the 1990s. But in some districts, it noted, the level of drug-crime disparity is actually getting worse. In Richmond, for example, the drug arrest rate for young black men was 2,043 per 100,000. The arrest rate for young white men was 477 per 100,000. In Philadelphia, the numbers were 2,248 per 100,000 and 730 per 100,000.\n\n{snip}\n\nA black man in his mid-20s or 30s who has not gone to college is, in the eyes of the federal government, a first-rate criminal.\n\nOriginal Article
