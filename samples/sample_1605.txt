More from this author »\n\nWith HBO's "Project Greenlight" now in its 15th season, Matt Damon has become synonymous with the annual contest. And with good reason: Damon is a founding executive producer of the reality series, which allows novice filmmakers to pitch their scripts to a panel of established filmmakers. (Notable winners include "Bridesmaids" writer Annie Mumolo and "Sorry to Bother You" writer/director Boots Riley.)\n\nNow, the two-time Oscar winner and five-time Golden Globe nominee has teamed with co-writer Ben Affleck to deliver a book that provides an inside look at their experience of discovering and developing original material.\n\n"Reinventing Hollywood: How the Entrepreneurial Spirit Is Transforming the Entertainment Industry" (Hachette Books, $26.00) will be released in April. As indicated by its title, the book will outline how the concept of auteur filmmaking has been challenged by the rise of the millennial, who wants to have a say in the making of the film.\n\n"When I think of a 'Citizen Kane' or a 'Godfather,' it's the vision of a single person and not a committee," Affleck told Variety. "I don't think we're in the era of the auteur. I think we're in the era of a lot of people trying to express themselves and be seen."\n\nAlso on Affleck and Damon's agenda: the "Ocean's" franchise. In November, they appeared at CinemaCon with director Gary Ross to unveil the first footage from the upcoming "Ocean's 8," which will star Sandra Bullock as Danny Ocean's sister and a crew of Hollywood's most talented women.\n\n"It's a movie about a heist," said Ross, who also directed the first two "Seabiscuit" movies and "Pleasantville." "You're going to get to know the crew."\n\n"Ocean's 8" is scheduled for release on June 8, 2018.\n\n© 2018 Variety Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media; Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC
