One of the most important decisions a parent will make is when and where to enroll their child in preschool. Of course, you want the best for your child. Unfortunately, a lot of parents who are faced with a limited budget are left wondering how they can find a quality preschool. The answer is simple, you have to do your research.\n\nFirst, ask friends, family, neighbors and colleagues if they can recommend a preschool that their child has attended. Talk to parents who have children of the same age as your child. If possible, look at their children's behavior to see if they are on track and if they are being challenged. Another option is to contact the preschool of your choice and ask about the cost of tuition. You will want to ask if there is a reduced rate for siblings. If the preschool is very expensive, ask if the center offers payment plans or scholarships. Also, ask about the center's hours, what is included in the tuition and their method of transportation for pick up and drop off.
