Two small studies have found that teen drivers who listen to music with the bass and treble turned up can’t hear important road noises and, in some cases, have a hard time distinguishing a police siren from a lawnmower or passing motorcycle.\n\nSo if you’re trying to convince your child to turn down the stereo, or maybe just trying to convince yourself, here are some facts about music and driving:\n\nMusic lovers are often oblivious to their favorite tunes while they’re driving.\n\nMany studies have shown that music lovers are often oblivious to their favorite tunes while they’re driving.\n\nAccording to the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, around two-thirds of drivers listen to music while driving, and 25 percent said they sometimes listen so loud that it interferes with their hearing.\n\nBut even when drivers don’t crank up the volume, background music can impair a driver’s hearing, and the consequences can be deadly.\n\nIn one recent study by AAA and the University of Utah, the average driver is distracted for about five seconds when a car passes them while playing loud music. That may not sound like much, but that’s enough time to increase the risk of a crash by nearly 400 percent.\n\nMusic can alter the way you drive.\n\nWith loud music and loud passengers, some drivers tend to push the limits to keep up. A University of Nebraska study of 20 teen drivers found that they drive more aggressively and take more risks when their music is loud and they’re accompanied by passengers.\n\nOther studies have found that drivers listening to loud music pay less attention to signs and signals, and they tend to drive faster.\n\nIn a 1999 study published in the journal Ergonomics, University of Texas researcher James Anderson played a series of music selections to participants while asking them to perform various driving tasks. The music they heard ranged from classical to heavy metal and was played at various decibel levels. The subjects were tested while driving in a simulator, and again while performing the same tasks while walking. The drivers were better at driving tasks when there was no music, or when the music was played at a low level. They performed worse when the music was loud or when it interfered with their driving ability.\n\nTurn it down.\n\nWhile there are lots of good reasons to keep the music down while you’re driving, the most important one may be that loud music interferes with your ability to hear other sounds.\n\nIn a 1993 study by the University of Southampton in England, researchers found that car drivers wearing headphones and listening to music at a level of 100 decibels couldn’t hear a fire engine’s siren until it was less than 40 meters away. That’s a big distance to be missing a siren, especially if you’re driving fast.\n\nWhat should you listen to?\n\nAny music you play in your car has the potential to distract you from what’s going on around you, but researchers say there are some types of music that are more distracting than others.\n\nA study by Frank Drews of the University of Munich in Germany, published in Applied Cognitive Psychology in 2000, found that music with a fast tempo and heavy bass line is the most distracting. Other studies have found that music with words is more distracting than instrumental music.
