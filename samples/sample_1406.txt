(CNN) As Theresa May was moving into Downing Street on Wednesday, a new bridge was opening across the river Severn.\n\nThe Britannia Bridge -- that uninspiring name chosen to reflect the post-Brexit aim of forging close ties with the Commonwealth -- cost Â£100 million, but it's meant to save drivers hours of frustration by providing a faster route between north and south Wales.\n\nThere's been a crossing here since 1763, when the current bridge was built -- the first to cross the Severn estuary -- and its opening was described in a contemporary report as an occasion of "the utmost consequence to the public."\n\nThis week, the new crossing was hailed by the first minister of Wales as a symbol of the strength of the union. Carwyn Jones was joined on the bridge by Prime Minister Theresa May, whose government had contributed to the cost, as well as Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.\n"
