The law can be so cold, it seems.\n\nA grieving couple has been separated for two years, ever since they took a life insurance payout and left the country — leaving behind an ailing mother.\n\nShawna, 41, and Neil Egan, 43, of Pickering, collected $2 million in life insurance benefits after they died in a vehicle crash in Thailand in 2014, The Sun reported.\n\nBut before they died, they made a decision that has put their family in a terrible bind.\n\nTheir mother, Sharon, 83, a woman in poor health, lived in their Pickering home with a “caretaker” while they travelled abroad.\n\nWhen Neil and Shawna died in the crash, they left no will and the money was paid to their mother.\n\n“I do feel guilty that we left, but I can’t turn back the clock,” Neil told a friend before his death, according to a Facebook post from his sister, Jane Egan.\n\nThe crash happened on Christmas Day in 2014, when the Egans’ car swerved off the road and crashed into a tree in Thailand, killing them both.\n\nSharon suffered a stroke after the crash and became bed-ridden. The house was sold and the Egans’ wills were locked in a safe.\n\nSharon Egan said she is struggling to get by. She has $600 a month from CPP, $2,000 a month from Canada Pension and a $1,400 monthly pension from the Ontario government, and pays $800 a month in rent.\n\nShe relies on her cataract surgery benefits for eye care, and pays out of pocket for dental.\n\nThe Egans' wills were locked in a safe.\n\nHer adult children told her she would receive the $2 million in insurance money, but she hasn’t seen a penny.\n\n“I’m not a millionaire,” she said. “I can barely afford to live on what I have.”\n\nThe sisters-in-law have never spoken in person and haven’t seen each other since Shawna and Neil died.\n\nThe Egans' wills were locked in a safe.\n\nShawna’s daughter, Meaghan, 20, wants to meet her grandmother, but cannot unless she takes a DNA test.\n\n“I am a young 20-year-old and have my whole life ahead of me,” Meaghan said. “I’m not really worried about the money.”\n\n“I’d like to have my grandmother in my life, that’s what I really want,” she said.\n\nFellow Pickering resident Lesli Miller-Koch told CityNews that she has not spoken to her daughter, Kimberly, in two years.\n\n“I miss her,” Miller-Koch said. “I miss her, I miss her. I really do.”\n\nCityNews reached out to the Egans’ executor and Shawna’s executor for comment.
