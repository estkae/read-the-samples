Naruto already knows how to get EMS, and he only needed like half a year to learn sage mode, so I don't think sasuke will need as much time to get EMS as long as he trains.\n\n\n\nYeah, but sasuke can copy the others techniques and he won't need as much time to get EMS if he trains.

Naruto already knows how to use sage mode, he just has to get the right power to do that, the only thing he needs to do is get his hands on the power.

I think sasuke's ability to use other people's techniques is a great thing, and I can see how he would be able to use all their techniques except for sage mode. I don't know if he'll need to die to be able to do that though, I don't think he'll have to. He"
