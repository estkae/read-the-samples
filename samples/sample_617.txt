Bath, Maine\n\nI live in an old industrial town, and the air can get pretty polluted. When I was a kid, my family would drive down to our house on the shore, and within a half-hour, my chest would start to feel tight. As a scientist, I was surprised to find that my personal experience matched the research: The impact of air pollution on your health is immediate.\n\nThe worst effects of air pollution are known as “socioeconomic depravation,” and include asthma, allergies, heart disease, stroke, and Alzheimer’s. The worst air pollution is caused by emissions of ozone and nitrogen oxide from the burning of fossil fuels and biomass, along with particulates from dust, dirt, soot, and smoke.\n\nAbout 5.5 million people die every year from air pollution exposure, but the relationship between emissions and disease is often overlooked. We have a major health crisis here.\n\nRecently, our federal government pulled out of the Paris climate agreement, which limits the average global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius.\n\nBut even if all countries met that goal, it still would not be enough. We need to limit the global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Otherwise, we’re looking at what’s called a “climate departure”—a change so severe that it will create a whole new climate system.\n\nI’m a professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of Southern Maine. I’m also an activist—I’ve been arrested three times for civil disobedience at the White House, to protest the proposed Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nAnd I’m doing my best to put a personal face on climate change. The problem is that"
