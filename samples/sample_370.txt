I love hand-cranked coffee grinders, but a fully automated device that grinds directly into the portafilter has always been one of the holy grails of coffee brewing. The Ekobrew takes a lot of the guesswork out of the whole process. Fill the hopper with whole coffee beans, twist the top to open, drop the portafilter in, turn the handle a few times and you’re ready to make your espresso.\n\nThe container is made of a non-porous material, so you can put ground coffee in it. It also has a couple of holes on the side, so that you can clean it and store it without having to remove the portafilter. The concept is pretty ingenious, but I had some difficulty in actually getting it to work properly.\n\nIn theory, the machine takes a lot of the stress out of making espresso. When it works, the espresso is good. It has a big enough capacity that I could probably make it twice before having to refill it. It would be nice if there was a better way to tell how full it was.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s a fairly unreliable method of extracting espresso. You can only have it set to brew for a specific amount of time. You can’t use any sort of fancy steaming wand to make sure the pressure is exactly right, or adjust the grind to get a specific flavour. I think this device is designed for making a quick shot in the morning and then tossing the puck after the shot is made.\n\nThis is the kind of device that I can imagine being useful to take on a trip, or maybe for an RV or camper, but not in a regular espresso bar or cafe. At the price of $50, I can’t really recommend it, though I do think that it has potential. If it were a bit more inexpensive, I think it would be worth experimenting with.
