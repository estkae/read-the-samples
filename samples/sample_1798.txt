Some of the smallest ideas can make the most profound differences. Two-time Emmy winner, Jayne Trcka, an instructor in Oregon State’s College of Public Health and Human Sciences and a professor in the College of Agricultural Sciences, has spent the last five years attempting to figure out a better way to harvest soybeans in Asia.\n\nTwo-time Emmy winner Jayne Trcka and OSU undergraduates Jeremy Williams and Andrew O’Shaughnessy (left to right) spend time with farmers in China and Vietnam.

It means she must figure out how to collect and use all of the soybeans and use them to help impoverished people in those countries.\n\n“There’s a lot of waste from soybean harvesting,” Trcka says. “Right now, most of the waste is burned. If you burn it, you create air pollution. But we’re also looking at creating a more sustainable, cleaner crop.”\n\nTo that end, Trcka, who holds an Oregon State master’s degree in human nutrition, was awarded a $450,000, five-year grant from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to study alternative uses for soybean harvest waste. Her work was recently featured on the OSU Research & Discover magazine Web site, http://researchdiscover.oregonstate.edu/archive/soybean-waste.\n\n“Soybean waste is actually a very valuable crop nutrient,” Trcka says. “In the United States, we just burn it, but in Asia, they actually use it as a nutrient for their crops. There are tremendous opportunities to use it as a food supplement or fertilizer. We’re trying to find the best way to harvest and process it.”\n\nTrcka is a professor of food science and human nutrition. Her project will involve a multi-disciplinary effort, including undergraduate and graduate students, and a team of researchers from Oregon State, Washington State, the University of Washington, Cornell University and the University of Illinois.\n\n“Part of this research is going to include Oregon State students,” Trcka says. “We’re going to look at the use of soybean waste in Vietnamese and Chinese diets, and how we can get more value from the waste. We’re also looking at developing a better process for collection.”\n\nThat process, Trcka says, would include how to make better use of the soybean waste through some type of fermentation process.\n\n“What we’re doing is providing food security, and also helping to reduce pollution,” she says. “And we’re helping farmers grow crops that are more sustainable and environmentally friendly.”\n\nContact:\n\nJayne Trcka, 541-737-7160, jayne@cohn.oregonstate.edu
