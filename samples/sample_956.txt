news, local-news,\n\nNorthern NSW Public Transport (NNSWPT) and Member for Tweed Byron Smith are currently in talks about how public transport can help alleviate congestion on the Tweed’s roads. Mr Smith has discussed the public transport funding the state government will make available as well as the project plans and improvements in the pipeline, according to the NNSWPT. “The key thing is that we’ve talked about is increasing the frequency of buses. We’ve got the fast ferry and the proposed bus network,” he said. “So they’re the two things that are the critical things at the moment. We’re looking at making the buses run faster and more frequently so it’s a more attractive option.” The NNSWPT is currently working on a new bus network for the Tweed. A consultation paper for the network is set to be released later this year. Mr Smith has been working with the organisation on plans for bus and ferry services and other public transport improvements in the Tweed. The NNSWPT said the organisation was keen to address the congestion problems in the area. Mr Smith said the Tweed had a “pretty long way to go” in terms of public transport and he was aware of the lack of services. “The bus is quite difficult to get to the fast ferry,” he said. “I’ve done the bus to Murwillumbah and the buses only run every hour and sometimes they’re very late.” Mr Smith said he had put forward a number of options to the NNSWPT, including an “express bus” to bring people from Tweed Heads to Murwillumbah, where they can then get the fast ferry. “I think that’s a good option and I think we need to look at that,” he said. “It’s a major issue that’s got to be addressed.
