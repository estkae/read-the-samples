HBO's Game of Thrones is quite a piece of entertainment, with a fan base so devoted that the network has used it to set a Guinness World Record for social media use.\n\nWhen it comes to the other side of the series -- the actors' paychecks -- it's fair to say that money doesn't flow like wine and the houses are in financial disarray.\n\nBritish actor Kit Harington, who plays Jon Snow on the hit series, spoke to the Daily Mail this week and was blunt about the lower pay grade compared to other stars on the show.\n\n“No one is getting paid more than I am," Harington said, confirming the public suspicions of many. “I think they know that I am the one that everyone wants to watch.”\n\nHarington was reportedly paid less than $40,000 per episode in season one, but he is making significantly more now. The Daily Mail claimed he earned about $200,000 per episode last season and said he is on track to earn $1.1 million for season five.\n\nThe show is filming right now and is set to air in April.\n\nHBO announced it had ordered the sixth and seventh seasons of Game of Thrones just days after the fifth season concluded, so that's more good news for Harington.
