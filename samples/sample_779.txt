As far as I understand it, you take points away from the PC's overall score if they do certain things. This works for most things, but I have a problem with how it works with imprisonment.\n\n\n\nLet's say that I am in a situation where I could be imprisoned. I choose not to and stay free. The Referee informs me that my score is reduced. I get it, I lose some points. But the next time I get arrested, I'm still scoring 0 because the first time I was arrested was when my score was still 100.\n\n\n\nIs there a way to correct this or is it an intentional part of the system that it doesn't take into account the situation that you already had to get arrested for the first time?\n\nGive us a bell if you are coming to GenCon! We'll give you a sticker and make sure to meet you!
