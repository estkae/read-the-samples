Computational science is the mathematical study of the behavior of physical systems. It covers a range of applications, from astronomy to economics, from chemistry to earth science.\n\nEach branch of computer science has its own internal history and its own research community, but it's possible to make sense of them all. This book brings them all together, and tells the story of how the tools we use today have evolved over the past six decades.\n\nThe book uses two cases studies to illustrate the benefits and the challenges of the interplay between computer science and science. The first is the evolution of computational physics.\n\nThe second is the evolution of computational astronomy.\n\nThroughout the book, the focus is on explaining the impact of these tools on science.\n\nEarly computer science was limited by the capabilities of the computers that existed in the 1960s and 1970s. Those computers lacked the resources to solve complex problems that were more than a few orders of magnitude above the size of those computers. The book begins with a detailed exploration of the problems we faced as computer scientists, and the solutions we developed. It concludes by looking at the technological advances that have created the current computing landscape. Along the way, we will explain the basics of computational science, and show how computing tools are a central part of modern scientific practice.
