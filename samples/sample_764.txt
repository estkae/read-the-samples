"20.12.2010\n\nLaser 4.0, EUROFORUM – The role of innovation in a period of crisis: Claudio Dematté: Online innovation: Increasing competition in the global economy requires flexible strategies.\n\nDuring the 7th edition of Laser 4.0, EUROFORUM – The role of innovation in a period of crisis, which took place on the 18th of November in Venice, Claudio Dematté discussed about “online innovation”, a concept increasingly adopted by companies with the aim to develop new business models.\n\n\n\nClaudio Dematté is Associate Professor of Management and Strategy at LUISS University. He has been coordinating the Communication Technology Laboratory at LUISS since 2007 and he has been a member of the Telecommunication Research Centre (C.T.R.) since 2008.\n\n\n\nClaudio Dematté is the author of articles on the topics of innovation, high technology and competition and he has also published several books.\n\n\n\nHis latest book, “Alla ricerca della tecnologia dei miracoli”, addresses the issue of competition in the information technology sector, analysing, in particular, the evolution of the competitive structure, new forms of alliances and companies’ business models.\n\n\n\nDuring his lecture, Claudio Dematté presented the results of his research on the technology sector, which demonstrate that the use of new technologies has not been a determining factor in the company’s performance in the last ten years, in particular as regards innovation.\n\n\n\nThis approach highlights the importance of developing innovative strategies based on collaborative alliances, and on an analysis of the local and international competitive scenario. The various steps of this analysis have the aim to understand how competitive pressure is affected by local and international factors, and to gain an overview of the innovative strategies adopted by the main players.\n\n\n\nIn order to understand the way in which innovations are being developed and commercialised in different sectors, Dematté carried out an analysis of the companies that are among the most innovative worldwide, together with their respective characteristics and with their distribution in different sectors.\n\n\n\nThe importance of online innovation is increasing. Analysing the phenomenon of e-commerce in detail, Dematté explained that the traditional retail models are losing ground to the new approaches and the new technology is driving companies towards a new vision of how to develop new products and services.\n\n\n\nThe use of the Internet has turned the e-commerce market into an increasingly competitive field, in which “follower strategies”, such as the launch of specific websites and of niche products, have become more common.\n\n\n\nOnline innovation is therefore a reality, however in order to make the most of this phenomenon companies have to develop a “strategic vision” of the e-commerce market.\n\n\n\nThe lecture of Claudio Dematté was followed by a panel discussion in which, among the other speakers, Giulio Tremonti, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Economy and Finances, took part.
