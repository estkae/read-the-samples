Myke was found on the streets, alone and abandoned. Luckily for Myke, his rescuer was a kind man who cared enough to find him a good home. Now Myke is living the life of a happy and loved cat. His new parents provide him with plenty of affection, and lots of toys. His favorite is a stuffed squirrel toy which he loves to carry around and hide under furniture.\n\nBut, Mykeâ€™s favorite toy is a shiny ball. When he brings it over for a playdate with Phoenix, the two buddies take turns batting it back and forth. This makes for hours of fun for these two adorable kitties!
