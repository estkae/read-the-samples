"It's hard to imagine a wittier book than one subtitled A Primer on the Tactics of Scientific Research. But, then, David M. Kaplan and Robert M. May are not your ordinary scientists. At one time or another, they've all but single-handedly invented chaos theory, championed the concept of selfish genes, coined the phrase "keystone species," and discovered the homeotic genes responsible for the formation of the vertebrate body plan. For sheer force of intellect, they're among the world's most eminent biologists.\n\nYou might, then, think that there would be little for these geniuses to learn from a primer in scientific methodology. But, as it turns out, that's just not so. In the same style of mordant humor that makes "The Ant and the Peacock" one of the best-selling books on evolutionary biology, Kaplan and May delightfully explain why it's difficult for a scientist to break away from deeply ingrained habits of thought.\n\nThey also introduce the problem of citation errors--a problem that has become all too apparent in the aftermath of The Bell Curve, whose authors committed a blizzard of them, citing everything from studies that were never performed to nonexistent journals. Kaplan and May suggest ways to prevent citation errors and to identify them when they do occur. They reveal that it's possible to fabricate a scientific journal, and to fool people into believing it's real.\n\nBut they don't confine their attention to egregious examples of scientific malfeasance. On the contrary, "The Art of Scientific Research" is written as a series of serious and not-so-serious instructions on how to conduct research, how to get it published, and how to cite it accurately. There's even a section on the art of collaboration, complete with sage advice on how to make it work. "The Art of Scientific Research" is a book for anyone who does science, or wants to.
