The US Census Bureau has just released the latest data on commuting to work. In 2010, the average travel time to work was 25.5 minutes in the US, which is just a bit higher than in 2000, when it was 24.5 minutes.\n\nThe top five states with the longest commute times were:\n\nWest Virginia, with an average commute time of 34.2 minutes.\n\nDelaware, with 33.7 minutes.\n\nMaryland, with 33.4 minutes.\n\nPennsylvania, with 33.2 minutes.\n\nMissouri, with 32.8 minutes.\n\nThe top five states with the shortest commute times were:\n\nSouth Dakota, with 19.1 minutes.\n\nSouth Carolina, with 20.3 minutes.\n\nMontana, with 20.8 minutes.\n\nArkansas, with 20.8 minutes.\n\nNevada, with 20.9 minutes.\n\nThe graph below compares the average commute time in 2010 with the US average for 2000 and 2005.\n\nA quick look at the map of commute times in the US suggests that higher commuting costs aren't quite as widespread as you might think. Looking at the top ten counties with the highest and lowest commuting costs, we see that the East Coast tends to have higher commute times, while the West Coast has lower costs. This is consistent with the data I posted back in September, which showed higher commute times along the coasts.\n\n[Source: Table 11]
