Description\n\nIn 1911 James Dawson Bradfield (1859-1935), president of the Calgary Board of Trade, helped organize the Calgary and Edmonton Railway Company. His aim was to build a railway linking the cities, and he began making plans for the venture after he had returned from Europe, where he had seen a number of successful long-distance railways. On September 2, 1912, Bradfield was elected the president of the Calgary and Edmonton Railway Company. Although Bradfield held this position only for a short period, he remained a director of the company and acted as the consulting engineer until his death.
