The old man had finally started letting him do more things on his own, such as make deals with the city of Chicago.\n\nAt the moment he was in his office getting a briefing from Mr. Fredrickson, his assistant.\n\n"The latest bounty is on something that is causing a lot of damage to the people in the city. It's probably best to explain the damage to you in person," Fredrickson suggested.\n\nThey both headed to the police station. Fredrickson had a theory as to what was causing the damage and had contacted the police.\n\nFredrickson's theory turned out to be correct. It was a monster, and it had been causing a lot of damage and injuries, but they were on the right track to capturing the monster.\n\n"You mean that thing is going to be mine," the old man said when he got word that the monster had been captured.\n\n"Yes sir, we are on our way to get it now," the officer informed him.\n\n"I'll meet you at the stadium," the old man said.\n\n"You want to come to the stadium," Fredrickson asked.\n\n"I do, I want to see this thing," the old man said with a grin.\n\n"Why," Fredrickson asked.\n\n"I just want to see it," the old man answered.\n\nAs the two walked back to the old man's car Fredrickson suggested he do something a little different with the bounty this time.\n\n"This thing is more dangerous than the last two that were captured, why do you want to go see it," Fredrickson inquired.\n\n"Let's just say that I want to make sure that the right person is getting the bounty," the old man answered.\n\n"Fine, I'll call them and tell them to make sure to bring the creature in the arena," Fredrickson said.\n\n"Good, call them now," the old man said.\n\nFredrickson called and told the team that they were bringing in the monster and it was going to be brought into the arena and they had to get the area ready.\n\nAfter the call was made, the old man and Fredrickson drove to the arena.\n\nWhen they got there the old man went to the back area and took off his suit and put on a set of referee's gear.\n\n"You sure you want to do this," Fredrickson asked.\n\n"I'm sure, now go call them and tell them we're ready," the old man ordered.\n\nFredrickson called and then the two waited for the team to show up.\n\nAfter a few minutes the team showed up with the monster in tow.\n\n"It looks mean," Fredrickson said as the team pulled the creature into the arena.\n\n"It does look mean," the old man replied.\n\nAs the two watched the creature in the arena the old man asked a few questions of the men.\n\n"When did it show up here," he asked.\n\n"It came in about six months ago," the leader of the team answered.\n\n"How did you capture it," the old man asked.\n\n"We don't know, we just heard a scream and when we went to check on it, it was already bound up," the leader answered.\n\n"Do you have a picture of what the thing looks like," the old man inquired.\n\n"Yes, we have a picture of it," the leader answered.\n\n"May I see it," the old man asked.\n\nThe leader handed the old man a picture of the creature.\n\n"This doesn't look like the same one," the old man said as he looked at the picture.\n\n"We don't know, maybe this is a different one," the leader suggested.\n\n"This looks more like the picture of the monster I fought a long time ago," the old man said as he handed the picture back.\n\n"It's not the same thing, the one you fought was green and this one is yellow," the leader said.\n\n"Yes, I know what I'm talking about," the old man said.\n\n"If it's not the same thing then why are you concerned," the leader asked.\n\n"This monster could be very dangerous, why haven't you done more research," the old man inquired.\n\n"I don't know," the leader admitted.\n\n"You need to study this thing, do some research and if you can't find anything, then maybe you should move it to another city," the old man suggested.\n\n"I'll talk to my superiors," the leader said.\n\n"Good," the old man replied.\n\n"I'm sure that I can find more information if I can get this one back to my lab," Fredrickson said.\n\n"I'm sure you can," the old man replied.\n\nThe team was about to move the creature into the arena to meet with their local hero when a man walked up and started talking to the leader.\n\nThe old man looked at the man and recognized him as a former wrestler, and a very dangerous one at that.\n\n"Hey, that guy is the one who can beat this monster," the former wrestler said.\n\n"How can you be sure," the leader asked.\n\n"I can beat this monster because I once fought a monster like this one and he defeated it," the former wrestler explained.\n\n"Why don't you do it," the leader suggested.\n\n"Fine, but I want the same money that you were going to give the other guy," the former wrestler requested.\n\n"Okay, let's get this over with," the leader said.\n\n"Yes sir," the former wrestler said.\n\nThe former wrestler walked over to the monster and started talking to it. The monster got angry and threw a punch at him.\n\n"It's angry," Fredrickson said.\n\n"I can see that," the old man replied.\n\n"If he can't beat it, we can always use it," Fredrickson said.\n\n"Let's see what happens," the old man said.\n\nThe former wrestler dodged the punch and was able to get his arms around the creature's neck and was able to pin it to the ground.\n\n"This could be bad," Fredrickson said.\n\n"It's not going to be bad," the old man replied.\n\nThe former wrestler held the creature down and then twisted its head around until it snapped off.\n\n"That's one dangerous man," Fredrickson said.\n\n"He is, let's go talk to him," the old man said.\n\n"Okay," Fredrickson said.\n\nThe two walked over to the former wrestler and talked to him.\n\n"You're good, I want to talk to you," the old man said.\n\n"I'm listening," the former wrestler said.\n\n"What are you doing now," the old man asked.\n\n"I'm working on the docks," the former wrestler answered.\n\n"I have a friend that owns a gym, and I'm sure that I could get him to help you out," the old man suggested.\n\n"If I go to this gym, who will I be fighting," the former wrestler asked.\n\n"That depends on who you think is the right person," the old man answered.\n\n"I know, but how do"
