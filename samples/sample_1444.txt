After playing its first home game at Fargodome this season, North Dakota State has three of its last four games away from home, including a trip to Indiana State.\n\nThe Bison have a new starting quarterback in redshirt freshman Easton Stick and a trip to face Indiana State on Nov. 14 should provide a big test. The Sycamores are 6-3 with wins over two Football Championship Subdivision opponents and a loss to a Football Bowl Subdivision team, Tennessee State.\n\nA win would boost NDSU's hopes for an at-large spot in the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision tournament, while a loss could knock the Bison out of the playoffs.\n\nHere are five things to watch in this matchup between a pair of Football Championship Subdivision unbeatens:\n\nDETERMINED DREY\n\nIndiana State senior defensive end Jake Drey's performance will likely determine the outcome of this game.\n\nNDSU coach Chris Klieman called Drey a "very good football player." The Bison's offensive line was inconsistent in last week's win over South Dakota State, so Drey and his defensive line mates will need to pressure Stick into making some mistakes.\n\n"They've got good players all around," Klieman said. "He's the guy that plays the position that can wreak havoc in the backfield."\n\nNDSU's offensive line must block Drey one-on-one if possible and allow Stick time to get the ball out. Klieman said he expects the Bison to be in three-wide receiver sets and Stick to use the screen game to pick up yards.\n\nTOUGH ROAD TEST\n\nNDSU is one of two unbeaten teams in the Missouri Valley Football Conference, and the Bison are the conference's only team that is 7-0 overall.\n\nIndiana State, a member of the Missouri Valley, would love to end NDSU's undefeated run. Klieman said he expects the Sycamores to put a lot of pressure on the Bison and "throw everything at us."\n\n"We've just got to stay calm, be ourselves and stay with our process," Klieman said. "That's what we did last week. We just got to be able to stay with it, protect the football and run the football."\n\nCOMEBACK ATTEMPTS\n\nWhile NDSU's offense is still trying to find its groove, the Bison have already shown they are willing to make a game of it in the second half.\n\nNDSU has been in two tight games this season -- at Iowa State and against South Dakota -- and the Bison have come from behind to win both times. Last week, NDSU led 14-0 at halftime, then scored 17 points in the third quarter to put away South Dakota State.\n\n"We've just got to stay patient," NDSU quarterback Easton Stick said. "We've got to let the game come to us. We can't go into a game trying to force anything. That's the big thing."\n\nRECEIVER RUSH\n\nIndiana State's secondary has been outstanding this season, and the team's top two receivers -- Demetrius Dean and Jonathan Shepherd -- could provide NDSU with a good test.\n\nDean leads the team with 45 catches for 531 yards and three touchdowns. Shepherd has 40 catches for 662 yards and seven scores. NDSU senior cornerback Marcus Williams said it will be critical for him to be more aggressive against the two Indiana State receivers.\n\n"They're really shifty, so we've got to play press coverage," Williams said. "They have good hands and good routes, so we've got to play our technique and go from there."\n\nBACKUP QBS\n\nNDSU's redshirt freshman quarterbacks, Stick and redshirt sophomore Easton Pedersen, are both coming off their first starts in a Bison uniform.\n\nPedersen threw a touchdown pass, but NDSU coaches felt Stick made a better decision with the ball. Klieman said both players will get a chance to play this season and possibly this week.\n\n"Easton (Pedersen) and Easton (Stick) are two young guys that are competing for playing time, and we're going to go with the guy that gives us the best chance to win," Klieman said.
