2 5 5 5\n\nCan't use in my kitchen- Need a work space I got this item as a gift and never really used it. It's a neat idea, but the fact is, in my kitchen, I don't have a place to keep the stand, and it has to stay there for it to work, so it's not an item that works in my kitchen.

She raves about it and it looks like it's really going to be a useful tool for prepping all kinds of things!

I have only used it to cut up onions and garlic but it is so easy to set up and use. I am considering buying one for my house.

I don't understand how a blade so fine could leave so much in the onion. It is a nice design, though. October 31, 2013
