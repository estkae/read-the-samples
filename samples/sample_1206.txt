At an event on Wednesday, Microsoft rolled out some new features for the company's Xbox One, which is probably why shares of the gaming company popped more than 7 percent.\n\nThe new features are:\n\n1. Improved entertainment experiences.\n\n2. Better access to apps.\n\n3. More flexibility and options for storing content.\n\nAll good things. However, if I were to offer some constructive criticism for the company it would be to:\n\n1. Improve entertainment experiences.\n\nThe company has to do a better job of making its product more useful. We're really only talking about two issues: One is the value proposition. Currently, Microsoft is selling its console for $399, which is about $100 more than the PS4.\n\nNow it may sound like a lot, but it's really not that much for a quality gaming system. I get that Sony's product is more expensive, but there's a value to the higher price point in terms of the ability to play certain games.\n\nIf I can play the latest Spiderman and Call of Duty, then I'm okay with paying $100 more for that. What I'm not okay with is that my friends can't see my playing those games.\n\nI think Microsoft has to do a better job of communicating how its Xbox platform is more valuable. By that I mean how is Xbox more valuable to consumers than a PS4.\n\nMicrosoft does a pretty good job of showing off the Xbox One's ability to record video game footage. It's something that's really impressive. But it's hard to see how much value it has until there are more games that leverage the Xbox One's unique capabilities.\n\nAnd I can only see that happening if there are more games that come to the Xbox One. I'm sure that's a chicken and the egg problem. Microsoft needs to get developers to create games for its console and the more games there are, the more likely people will buy the Xbox One.\n\n2. Offer access to more apps.\n\nWhat's the point of a console if I can't use it to run Netflix?\n\n3. Keep making your console's storage more flexible.\n\nOne of the big problems with owning an Xbox is that there's not much space to store games. That's the reason why I've given up on getting the system to record video games.\n\nBut I like to have games stored on my console. Not just the ones that I'm playing now, but some games that I know I'll play later.\n\nThe PlayStation 4 doesn't offer much in terms of internal storage either, but the Xbox One's storage seems particularly limited. I guess the company thinks that I'll be happy with only 500 GB.
