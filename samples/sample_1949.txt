China is working on a new jet trainer that could be used to replace the JJ-7 Flanker. The aircraft will be powered by a Russian engine.\n\nSeveral prototypes of the aircraft have been made and are in testing. However, it is believed that the project will be put on hold as a result of Russiaâ€™s ban on arms exports to China.
