"And, on that note, we’re all set. I would like to once again thank my daughter Riya, who put up with the “Okay, wait, let me take a selfie…” requests, and my fellow Ranters/bloggers who participated in this insane challenge:\n\nJakob, Jeff, and Jason – you’re awesome!\n\nNow, as a special treat, here’s a bonus question for you…\n\nIn honor of all things shark, can you name the three greatest shark movies ever made?\n\n[You can use YouTube if you’re not sure]\n\nFor me, the correct answer is:\n\nJaws, Jaws 2, and Jaws 3 (The first one is a no-brainer. As for the others, it’s a tie between Michael Caine and the Chief of Police and that damn shark as far as I’m concerned).\n\nThanks again for the great questions and happy #SharkWeek!
