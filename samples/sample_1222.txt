\n\n5 of 5 people found the following review helpful Simple and effective, 27 Aug. 2011 By JLH Verified Purchase What is this?) This review is from: Medisana Healther MRY-1 (Personal Care) This item arrived promptly from Amazon, well packed and with clear instructions. It was easy to set up and started working immediately. My partner now wears it on a nightly basis and reports that his sleep is improved. My only concern is that the elastic on the armband is very thin, and it seems to have stretched a little already, although that might be his own fault for not putting it on properly, I don't know. I suppose it would be easy to buy another one but why? It works well and is simple to use and set up. I'm going to order a spare one. Recommended.
