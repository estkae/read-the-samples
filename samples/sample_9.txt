"Say to them: 'As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, people of Israel?' declares the Sovereign Lord."\n\nEzekiel 33:11-11\n\nGod wants every sinner to be saved. He does not want people to perish but be saved. God hates sin, and sin destroys a person. But He loves people. He created them to have fellowship with Him and one day live in His Kingdom, and He does not want that for one person to be lost.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod's command to Ezekiel was that He was telling him to go and tell the people of Israel that they need to turn to God, because they were going to die if they did not. We know that Ezekiel told them the same thing, because God's word is truth. God's Word does not fail.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat God is saying is that people are going to die if they do not turn to Him. People who reject God will die. The Bible says in Romans 1:32, "Though they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them." God says that those people who do these things deserve death, and yet people continue to do them and approve of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod will not tolerate the sinful acts of humanity, but He wants every person to be saved. There is only one way to be saved. The Bible says in John 14:6, "Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'”\n\n\n\n\n\nNo one can be saved except through Jesus Christ, but when people put Jesus as their savior, they are saved. It's that simple.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many people who call themselves Christians who say that God wants everyone to be saved, and they quote Ezekiel 33:11 and John 3:16, but they don't realize that God's word is truth. God says in Revelation 21:8, "But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death."\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is only one way to be saved, and it is not through anyone or anything but Jesus Christ. Jesus is the only way to heaven. God says that all the people who are going to perish are going to go to a place called the second death. That's hell.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen people quote Ezekiel 33:11 and John 3:16, they don't realize that God's word is truth. They don't realize that when they say that God wants everyone to be saved, they are not telling the truth. When they say that God wants everyone to be saved, they are putting God in a box, because God's word is truth. God says that those who do not accept Jesus as their Savior are going to perish. God's word is truth, and people who do not put their faith in Jesus Christ are going to die.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bible says in John 14:6, "Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'”\n\n\n\n\n\nJesus is the only way to the Father, and no one can be saved except through Him. He died on the cross for our sins, and He rose from the dead on the third day, and He sits at the right hand of God, interceding for us. It's that simple.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's take a look at Ezekiel 33:11-11, and read it carefully.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Say to them: 'As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, people of Israel?' declares the Sovereign Lord."\n\n\n\n\n\nGod says that He takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked. God does not like it when people die. But God hates sin, and sin leads to death. If people want to live, they must turn from their sins and put their faith in Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf people don't put their faith in Jesus Christ, they are going to perish. God doesn't want that. He doesn't want people to perish, but to live.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod wants people to put their faith in Jesus Christ. If people put their faith in Jesus Christ, they are saved. If they don't put their faith in Jesus Christ, they are going to perish. That's the truth. That's the message of Ezekiel 33:11-11.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople are going to die if they don't put their faith in Jesus Christ. People will perish. People will be lost. People will be doomed. People will go to hell.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's read Ezekiel 33:11-12.\n\n\n\n\n\n"For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone," declares the Sovereign Lord. "Repent and live!"\n\n\n\n\n\nGod takes no pleasure in the death of anyone. God does not want anyone to perish. He doesn't want anyone to die. He wants people to repent and live. God is saying that He is not going to stand back and watch as people perish. He's going to do something about it.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod says in Ezekiel 33:13-16, "Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, people of Israel? I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Do you think I take pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Sovereign Lord. Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live? Don't presume that you can say to yourselves"
