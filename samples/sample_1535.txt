"If the US supreme court rules in favour of the controversial referendum, it could become one of the most important cases in the recent history of the judicial system.\n\nThe country’s supreme court is set to hear the case on 27 February. And a decision is expected to be reached within months, possibly even before June. If the US supreme court rules in favour of the controversial referendum, it could become one of the most important cases in the recent history of the judicial system.\n\nThe move is a “referendum on the imperial and colonial era of the US that will give more justice and freedom to the world”, according to North Korean state media.\n\nIt is also claimed that the supreme court is likely to accept the case because no less than ten US states have joined in to oppose the situation.\n\nWhile the idea of Washington stepping in to protect the DPRK’s people from its own government is absurd, it remains unclear as to what exactly the DPRK would be able to gain from the situation.\n\nIt is, however, important to note that North Korea does not take any kind of criticism well.\n\nThe Kim regime has on more than one occasion lashed out at the US for attempting to intervene. And while the U.S. cannot be solely responsible for the unfortunate situation that North Koreans find themselves in, they can make a conscious decision to help them.
