This was pretty much my reason for waiting, aside from being poor. I also had plans for my CM 4500 and had thought of swapping it for the pz when it was released (I had the pz when it was in its original verion). I just never could pull the trigger and finally went with the master series instead. For now, I really like the 4500, so I will probably be saving for a couple more years before I think about getting the pz.\n\nOn a side note, my 4500 just arrived a few hours ago. I am going to spend the rest of the evening putting it together. Not to mention, I have the CM Sprinter to finish assembling too.\n\nI am currently playing a lot of shooters so I will be using the 4500 for that and strategy/4X games. I really don't play sims much anymore.
