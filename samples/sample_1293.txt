This month, the technical and engineering staff at Woodruff Manufacturing gave a great presentation on their progress with applying the PFAST® process to their commercial markets.\n\nThey were following up on their success with the process as a customer development tool for both the multi-family housing market and the electric utility industry.\n\nThey showed pictures of the process (video and photos) in action, with engineering drawings of how they would design the product if it were ready for production. It was very well done and most impressive!\n\nBut, more importantly, they wanted to share their insights on how the process helped them better understand the electrical and mechanical trade-offs that had to be made. They wanted to explain how the process could bring clarity to their product development process, especially for their engineering team.\n\nIt is always great to see companies who are in the process of applying the PFAST® process as a customer development tool, applying it in a way that really benefits them, and finding out how it has worked in a way they did not expect!
