The Residences at the Ritz-Carlton\n\nThe Residences at the Ritz-Carlton (also known as the Ritz-Carlton Residences) are a collection of mixed-use buildings within the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C.\n\nThe buildings, which opened in 2016, occupy the former site of the Washington National Cathedral's Camp Mills military hospital, which was built in 1917 to treat wounded American soldiers during World War I. The hospital was the precursor to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. In the early 2000s, the Washington National Cathedral sold the Camp Mills site to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel for $25 million in order to raise money to cover maintenance and operating costs. The Ritz-Carlton Hotel constructed the Residences at the Ritz-Carlton on the property and purchased the remaining land from the cathedral. The residences consist of the , 45-story The Ritz-Carlton Residences, the 39-story The Residences at the Ritz-Carlton, and the five-story Ritz-Carlton Residences. The project was designed by Rafael Vinoly, with interior design by Thierry Despont and the landscape design by Peter Walker.\n\nThe residences were listed for sale in May 2017. A contract to sell the residences to an unnamed buyer was signed in July 2017, but the sales contract was cancelled in December 2017. In January 2018, the residences were again listed for sale with a $600 million price tag. The residences were again sold in February 2018 to the BTA Group, an investment fund controlled by the Thai billionaire Dhanin Chearavanont.\n\n\n
