"While the true identity of the picture of a dog wearing a baseball cap, trying to peer over a high fence at a tennis court has not yet been confirmed, a good story has been shared across the internet. According to the Huffington Post, a man named Michael at a Las Vegas community association, who goes by the username Lionhart28 on Reddit, says he and his dog Storm, seen in the picture, are both avid tennis players.\n\nMichael says he got Storm in June 2013, after he'd had a lot of difficulty finding the right puppy, and claims the dog has a "massive personality and plays with just about every dog she meets," according to the Huffington Post.\n\nStorm, a little over a year old, is a high-energy dog that loves to run, as Michael says. Storm is also "hyper," according to the Daily Mail.\n\nMichael says Storm often goes for runs with him, but that sometimes Storm becomes "too rambunctious" and causes trouble.\n\nStorm had been in one of these "troublemaking moods" on Wednesday when Michael was playing tennis. He brought the dog with him to the tennis courts, but when she saw a dog playing tennis in the park, she tried to bolt for it.\n\nMichael was able to grab her collar, but the next thing he knew, he saw the picture, which he called "kind of crazy."\n\nAt first Michael thought the picture was "cool," but later he said it felt like he was "showing off" his dog.\n\nThis may or may not be the actual identity of the picture, but Storm is a tennis-loving dog with an almost otherworldly ability to jump. Her personality, according to the Daily Mail, is also described as "full of life," and she likes to run and chase tennis balls.\n\nStorm also loves Michael, and he says he couldn't have asked for a better dog.
