Salicylic Acid is a great chemical exfoliant to help shed the outermost dead layers of skin, revealing the fresher, smoother skin below. I’ve been using the 10% concentration (I really don’t like to use anything stronger), and have seen great improvement in my skin since incorporating it into my routine. When I wear my glasses, I have been told I look more “refreshed” and “well-rested”. The application process is a bit time-consuming, but the payoff is worth it.\n\nWhile exfoliation is absolutely necessary to reveal a new layer of skin, I think the acid needs a little help in achieving optimal results. I have been using this weekly mask for about a month now and it is my new favorite:\n\nI like that it is a gel mask, and I leave it on for 20 minutes. This is the first product I have used that has given my skin an additional “boost”.\n\nThe ingredients for this mask: Water, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Sodium PCA, Hydrolyzed Corn Starch, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Sorbic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Allantoin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Butylparaben, Carbomer, Ceramide 2, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide I, Cholesterol, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan), Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract, Cyamopsis Tetragonoloba (Guar) Gum, Diglycerin, Dimethicone, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Ethylparaben, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hydrolyzed Corn Starch, Hydroxypropyl Trimonium Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hydrolyzed Wheat Starch, Lauramide DEA, Lecithin, Malic Acid, Maltodextrin, Mannitol, PEG-150 Distearate, Polyglyceryl-10 Oleate, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Sorbate, Retinyl Palmitate, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Sodium PCA, Sodium Polyacrylate, Stearamide AMP, Stearic Acid, Sucrose, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA.\n\nAdvertisements
