Farscape star Virginia Hey (a.k.a. the telepathic Peacekeeper Aeryn Sun) talks about her audition for the part of Queen Amidala, the controversial character of the Star Wars prequels and just what happened with Episode III.\n\n"I read for Episode III," she told reporters at the recent Wizard World Los Angeles, adding that she didn't make the final cut, but felt she "did a good job in the audition."\n\nHey's Aussie accent was probably a factor, she suggested, as George Lucas "is quite particular" about "that British accent." Hey actually got her first big break in an American production, playing a Japanese ninja in the 1988 Clint Eastwood movie The Dead Pool.\n\nAccording to Hey, she read for Episode III with the late Christopher Lee, who played Count Dooku in the movie. Lee, she said, had the room bursting into laughter when she saw him reading the scene with her.\n\nSo does that mean Lee was doing his performance all wrong? Hey answered the question by saying "I don't think that I could have ever come close to him."\n\nSo, what does she think of the Star Wars prequels?\n\n"They're well made, they're great films," she said, adding that "the first film is the one that always comes up when I'm talking about the movies."\n\nHey's Aussie accent probably didn't help her chances of being cast in the role of Padm√©.\n\nAs far as what fans thought of the prequels, Hey said she was never really sure because, "I wasn't in them."\n\nImage courtesy Virginian Hey.
