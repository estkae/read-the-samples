The trade war between the United States and China is threatening to become a full-blown war of words.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods in an escalating trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies. China has responded with its own plans to impose retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.\n\nThe White House said Tuesday that the U.S. government will begin collecting tariffs on the $200 billion worth of Chinese imports on Sept. 24, with the tariffs to rise to 25 percent on Jan. 1.\n\nChina said Friday that it will hit back with retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods if Washington goes ahead with its latest tariff threat.\n\nIn a statement, China’s Commerce Ministry said, “If the U.S. side obstinately clings to its course and takes any new tariff measures against China, China will be forced to take countermeasures.”\n\nIt added, “The two sides’ trade and economic relations have been affected by the unilateral and trade protectionist measures from the U.S. side.”\n\nThe United States said Monday that it would impose tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.\n\nChina had earlier announced plans to impose tariffs on $50 billion worth of U.S. goods, ranging from 5 to 10 percent.\n\nThe U.S. has been accusing China of stealing U.S. technology and trade secrets.\n\nThe two countries have been in negotiations for months over the trade dispute.\n\nU.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are holding talks in Washington this week. The two sides have little time left to reach a deal before a fresh round of tariffs takes effect.\n\nTrump has also threatened to hit China with tariffs on an additional $267 billion worth of Chinese imports if China hits back with tariffs on U.S. agricultural products.
