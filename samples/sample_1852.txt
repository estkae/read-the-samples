"The latest numbers from the Manpower group find that most managers don't feel their employees are at the top of their game. In fact, only 40% of managers rated their employees as performing at a "world class" level.\n\nInterestingly, the percentages were quite similar across industries and job levels. There was a noticeable difference, however, in the quality of employees at large and small companies. Fifty-one percent of employees at large companies rated themselves as world class, compared to just 31% at small firms.\n\nThe difference between small and large companies is consistent with the ongoing trend toward organizational downsizing and pressure to reduce headcount. The benefits of downsizing are generally viewed as lower costs and greater efficiency, but this is typically accomplished by reducing the level of resources allocated to the employees that remain, and a less than stellar employee experience. The results from the Manpower group's research suggest that while downsizing can help organizations achieve short-term cost-cutting goals, long-term productivity will suffer. In fact, the costs associated with poor employee morale can be very significant.\n\nHiring the right people, creating a good culture and atmosphere, and ensuring employees receive proper training can help avoid the potential downsides of downsizing. These measures can also help foster the growth of a "world class" organization. It's clear that it's possible for smaller organizations to provide world class service to their customers and business partners, but the message from this research is that only a small percentage of small firms are achieving that goal.\n\nDo you think the quality of the employees you work with is important? Do you work for a small company? Would your performance rating be different if you were at a large company?\n\nLearn more about what it takes to be a world class employee at the 10 Simple Rules of World Class Customer Service blog.
