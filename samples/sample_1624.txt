"Story by Mariella Trandafir\n\nLast month, a reporter for a BGN News outlet found himself standing outside the Bulgarian State Rowing Center, as its coach, German national Henrik Hargin, was telling reporters from the Bulgarian National TV Channel what happened inside the indoor rowing training pool a day before. He and his athletes were attacked by two unknown men.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe attacker allegedly “splashed” the coach, while the other hit his hand with a dumbbell. Hargin was sent to the hospital with multiple broken bones.\n\nThe event has become the biggest news in Bulgarian rowing, not to mention other fields of Bulgarian sport. Bulgarian police arrested the two individuals.\n\nThese two attackers are part of an organized crime gang. “A gang of criminals specializing in assault, robberies, drug trafficking and extortion. It was established after a football match last year,” said the head of the National Police Department’s Chief Directorate for Combatting Organized Crime, Ivan Geshev.\n\nWhy did this happen?\n\nThis is not the first time Hargin is the target of an assault. He was attacked two years ago by a group of five people. The coach said the second attack was ordered by a person he allegedly owes a sum of 2,000 levs.\n\nThe story was “invisible” to the police for more than a year. Hargin took the decision to go public and declare publicly that he knew who was behind the attack.\n\nSoon after the Bulgarian National TV aired the story, a man with a high-ranked position in the police said Hargin and his trainer were attacked by two people, but they were hired by two other people, who have nothing to do with organized crime.\n\nThis scenario was later declared fake by Bulgarian National Police Chief Commissioner Sotir Tsatsarov.\n\nIt was clear that the story with the first version was planted to avoid a serious problem, but the problem is the persons behind it.\n\nA politician, two policemen and a boxer\n\nHargin said the names of the persons behind the attack – three people – are well known to the authorities.\n\nOne of them is Svilen Neykov, the former head of the interior minister’s bodyguards and advisor of a major political figure in Bulgaria.\n\nHe was charged with the illegal possession of weapons in 2011. He was also charged with drug trafficking, with several related offenses.\n\nAnother person behind the attack is one of the owners of a luxury spa in Sofia. His company runs a branch in Greece.\n\nThe third person is Svilen Karov, former Bulgarian Amateur Boxing Federation’s head and former owner of a chain of fitness clubs in the country.\n\nNeykov, Hargin and Karov are well known to each other, since Neykov was the bodyguard of former Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov (1997 – 2001) and Karov was a member of the pro-government party GERB (Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria).\n\nA manager and a contract killer\n\nFor more than a year, Neykov and Karov have been in business relations with a manager from the world of sports, who also holds a senior position in the Interior Ministry.\n\nThis manager is known as the personal adviser of a former high-ranked police officer. The adviser is also a former president of the National Council for Combating the Corruption and Bribes.\n\nThis manager allegedly hired a contract killer for the first attack on Hargin.\n\nAfter this attempt failed, he allegedly ordered the two recent attacks. He would not only get rid of Hargin, but would also take the head coach position.\n\nMeanwhile, Neykov has close relations with this manager, with whom he has business interests.\n\nAfter the attack, the two “protectors” of Neykov were apprehended. The investigators took them to Hargin to show the assailants in court.\n\nWhen they left the rowing center, they started to ask who Hargin was and how he was injured. The rowing coach replied: “You don’t know me? You are the guys who attacked me.”\n\nAnd he confirmed their identities in front of a dozen reporters.\n\nThe plan failed\n\nAfter the attack on Hargin and his rowing team, the political figure behind Neykov (his manager) called the head of the Bulgarian National Police Department, Tsatsarov.\n\nTsatsarov also asked who was behind the attack. “Two thugs,” the political figure answered.\n\nBut this did not happen.\n\nSoon after the incident, the National Police Chief said the people behind the attack would be “severely punished.”\n\nSo far, only the two assailants have been arrested. And that was because Neykov and Karov were there when the attack happened.\n\nIf they were in the same car, when the attackers drove off in the car, Neykov and Karov would also be under arrest.\n\nPaid with bags of heroin\n\nIf the attempt to get rid of Hargin in the first attack did not work, it would be more difficult in the future, as he would be more careful.\n\nSo, Neykov needed more money to “hurt” Hargin.\n\nThere is another “party” involved in the scheme – the manager, who has close ties to Neykov. He is an alleged heroin dealer.\n\nThe manager apparently paid Neykov, who paid the two men to get rid of Hargin.\n\nHe told them to wait for Hargin and to show him their genitals when he comes out. Hargin was sprayed with a very strong product, then attacked with the dumbbell.\n\nThe assailants were paid with bags of heroin.\n\nHowever, the men involved in the attack did not know the person who hired them.\n\nThey were told it was a man from Sofia, who wanted to “get rid” of Hargin. He would pay them 1,000 euros each.\n\nThe story has shocked the rowing world.\n\nIt is obvious that whoever the person behind the attack on Hargin is, he is also behind the attacks on two other Bulgarian athletes: skier Todor Yanchev and soccer player Stiliyan Petrov.\n\nYanchev was attacked by two men in Velingrad in April. Petrov was beaten by two people outside his hotel in Sofia, two weeks after Yanchev was attacked.\n\nIn both cases, the attackers were paid with bags of heroin.\n\nThe only difference is that in the case of Yanchev, the attackers were Macedonians, who have “ties” with Bulgarian law enforcement, while the two men who attacked Petrov are not known to the police.\n\nThe protector of Neykov\n\nThere is a politician behind Neykov, but the public is still unaware of his name.\n\nHe has served as the head of an important body in Bulgaria’s government and is currently part of the European Parliament.\n\nThis politician has been connected to one of the biggest drug dealers in the country. The authorities know about his connection to the world of drug trafficking.\n\nAt the same time, he is said to have close connections with a major criminal group in Bulgaria. He is also the “protector” of Neykov.\n\nThe authorities would be unable to charge Neykov, who was charged with drug trafficking and several related offenses, if the politician did not protect him.\n\nWhat do these events mean?\n\nThe problem with sports corruption is no longer a matter of “media speculation.”\n\nA few months ago, a major scandal shook the Bulgarian basketball. The whole country was shocked to learn that a well-known figure in Bulgaria’s sports, who was also the owner of the Bulgarian Basketball Federation’s executive body, was under investigation for an alleged match-fixing scheme.\n\nIt seems like the problem is very serious. We should be concerned that a gangster has “a free hand” in the sports world.\n\nWe should be worried that someone can get rid of a coach with “a few dozen kicks” and “a few dozen pounds of heroin.”\n\nWhat next?\n\nThe public would probably be interested in knowing why the Bulgarian Prime Minister, Boyko Borisov, did not comment on this event.\n\nIf he does not react, people would be asking why he does not react. And if he reacts, he would most probably declare he knew nothing about this story.\n\nWhat is sure is that there are many questions that need answers, and the only one who can provide them is the Bulgarian Prime Minister.\n\nRead the original article in Bulgarian in Novinite.com
