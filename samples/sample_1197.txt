"\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars Powerful, enchanting, September 27, 2011\n\nThis review is from: When Your Eyes Change: An Amazon Kindle Edition (Kindle Edition)\n\nBeautiful and well-written. I’m really enjoying this series, and am really looking forward to seeing how things will be resolved in the last book.\n\nBy Cristine Patterson (Shelby Township, Michigan United States)\n\nFormat:Kindle Edition|Amazon Verified Purchase\n\nI was provided a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review. When Your Eyes Change is the second book in the Vampire Requiem Series. I read the first book in the series and loved it so much that I jumped right in to the second one. I would highly recommend this book and series to anyone who enjoys paranormal books. It’s different from all the vampire books that are out there and doesn’t make vampires the bad guys.
