News. "Her support is critical to the hospital and we are grateful for her help."\n\nMoore is competing on the show's 12th season with former General Hospital star Ingo Rademacher. Last night, Moore and Rademacher scored the first 10 of the season from judge Len Goodman.\n\nWhile Moore will donate her Dancing With the Stars appearance, some celebrities don't -- even though that's what's requested. They still get a share of the show's profits from voting. Last year, Katie Holmes said she wouldn't do Dancing With the Stars but she still did. She did donate the appearance fee she would have received from the show to the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2010, Jane Seymour donated the proceeds of her Dancing With the Stars appearance to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Also in 2010, season 11 winner Donny Osmond donated his Dancing With the Stars appearance fee to Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.\n\nDancing With the Stars airs Mondays at 8/7c on ABC.
