We've had a fire with smoke smell that has not disappeared. The contractors worked hard to solve the problem, but unfortunately, it was a difficult case. We ended up spending more than initially planned and I can't say it was money well spent. I am disappointed. The one problem was that the company was rather unresponsive and I had to follow up more than I would have liked. I would hire again.
