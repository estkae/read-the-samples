Louis Saha is waiting to find out whether the Achilles injury which forced his substitution against Arsenal will force him to miss the start of the season.\n\nThe France striker, who will be 32 on Thursday, sustained the injury on his right ankle during a training session in May.\n\nThe problem was successfully treated in the summer and he played a significant role in pre-season, even if he was not fit enough to take a full part in all the games.\n\nSaha said: "I'm waiting for the results of a scan I had yesterday, so I don't know if I will be available for the start of the season.\n\n"I have to see if I have a small tear, which would mean it would take one or two weeks to heal, or if it is worse.\n\n"It is a bit like a burn, which keeps breaking down, but I have to wait for the scan.\n\n"I was very surprised when I heard I had to come off against Arsenal, because I had played the 90 minutes against Chelsea and I had no problem.\n\n"Then I felt it during the warm-up before the game and I tried to put some painkillers on it to see if I could carry on but I couldn't."
