It was my first concert ever and was the best thing Iâ€™ve ever seen.\n\nAmazing. 5 By jonfreitag Ive been a BVB fan since 2015 and have followed the band for years now. Iâ€™ve been to all their shows and this concert is one of my favorites.\n\nwow 5 By Kaite Kyaw on youtube I saw them in October and this is the most amazing concert Iâ€™ve ever been too. best part is I got to get the hug of my life from Dan from Bring Me The Horizon, which is probably the best part of the concert. 10/10\n\n5 STARS 5 By YahwehIsAwesome99 You guys have no idea how much you changed my life.

Thanks for having all of us scream until weâ€™re hoarse, and I love how you bring out people to sing with you, especially that cute blond little girl in the grey sweater! :)\n\nGood concert! 3 By dracofiend There was a little bit of disconnect in terms of the lights and the crowd. It was kind of weird.\n\nAmazing. 5 By LondonkitCat Amazing.\n\nğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œ 5 By ChanMarieLovesPawPaw ğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œï¿½"
