This paper extends the framework of the intertemporal Tobit model in which explanatory variables are available only at the end of the sample to the multiple dependent variable case. The effects of endogeneity of these explanatory variables on the standard error of the estimated structural coefficients are quantified. A large endogeneity bias, whose size is not affected by the lag length, is found for all sets of variables, except the set with a positive effect on the last observed outcome, which is relatively immune to endogeneity bias. These results are used to analyze the effects of unobserved variables on the estimates of the true effects and on the standard errors of the estimated effects of observed variables. The impact of unobserved variables on the estimates is sometimes substantial.
