"By DontHassleDaHoff\n\nWe're heating things up with PROJECT: Overcharge in the upcoming Patch 7.24b!\n\nPROJECT: Overcharge\n\nAssault up, minions! Project: Overcharge replaces Stormrazor and Stormguard Banner, empowering your entire team with 10% increased attack speed and 8% increased movement speed for 15 seconds. In addition, you'll gain Overcharge stacks while attacking enemy champions and playing as Summoner's Rift objectives. The more you participate, the faster you charge!\n\nWith the PROJECT pre-season approaching, we're giving Overcharge a test run on the PBE!\n\nHow do I get Overcharge?\n\nYour team starts with a fixed number of Overcharge tokens that reset when you recall. You earn more Overcharge by killing enemy champions and playing as objectives.\n\nObjective Total tokens Rift Herald 2 Scuttle Crab 2.5 Dragon 4\n\nKilling an enemy champion generates 1 stack, but if you earn more than 5 stacks, you'll go into "overdrive" and get a short burst of additional movement speed and attack speed!\n\n1-5 stacks: +8% AS / 10% MS\n\n6-10 stacks: +16% AS / 20% MS\n\n11+ stacks: +24% AS / 30% MS\n\nOverdrive lasts 1.5 seconds and grants up to +120% bonus AS and +180% bonus MS!\n\nOverdrive ends immediately if you're dealt damage greater than 4% of your maximum health or if you activate Stormguard Banner.\n\nPROJECT: Hunters\n\nPROJECT: Hunters rewards map objectives and creating map pressure for your team. If you slay a jungle monster or help your allies take down an enemy Rift Herald, Dragon, or Baron, you'll earn a stack of PROJECT: Hunters.\n\n1 stack for Rift Herald\n\n2 stacks for Dragon\n\n4 stacks for Baron\n\n3 stacks for a secured Baron kill\n\nWhen you earn a stack of PROJECT: Hunters, you and your teammates are empowered for 15 seconds with +10% bonus movement speed and +10% bonus attack speed.\n\nPlay the objective and rack up those stacks to hunt for the enemy team!\n\nExhaust changes\n\nWe're making some changes to Exhaust that are designed to let it work better with aggressive crowd control effects.\n\nWe want to remove Exhaust's bonus AD ratio because it makes it really difficult to fight champions with both Exhaust and high attack speed. However, Exhaust should feel more effective against high attack speed targets because its slow should be more powerful.\n\nWe're doing this by reducing the duration of the slow by 10% but increasing the duration of the debuff that prevents the target from autoattacking by the same amount. Overall, this means that it'll be easier to reach the minimum Attack Speed slow but harder to reach the maximum Attack Speed slow.\n\nAlso, this means Exhaust won't affect attack speed-based champs as much because it'll take more time for the debuff to tick down.\n\nWe'll continue to assess Exhaust and other individual adjustments to hit our goals in the pre-season.
