So, I've used this for about a week and I'm loving it so far. This little gadget works better than I expected. We have used it as a colander and strainer (we actually bought it to help my wife with her rheumatoid arthritis and its helping) and its done a great job. I can't really see it being an issue unless you have a bad habit of dumping heavy objects on your hands. The holes are small enough that it does a good job of straining and letting the water through. We have also used it as a small colander for veggies and have used it in the shower to rinse and wash our hands. One of the main reasons we got this was to help with her arthritis and joint pain from getting food off of her hands. We're big fans of "drying" dishes by rinsing in the dishwasher with a cup of water and 1/4 of vinegar and this is perfect for that and getting a lot of the left over water off of our hands.\n\n\n\nI know some reviews say its too big for some, but honestly I think its the perfect size for what we need.\n\n\n\nTo"
