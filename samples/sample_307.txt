Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez practiced for the first time this week and appears on track to start Sunday against the Tennessee Titans.\n\nSanchez's right shoulder strain limited him in practice Wednesday, but he took most of the first-team repetitions. He was 15 of 19 passing with no interceptions and no sacks against a second-team defense. He said after practice that he would play against the Titans if the game were today.\n\n"It's great, it's great," Sanchez said of his arm strength. "The most important thing with an injury is to get the strength back. We're seeing good results of that. ... That's the main thing."\n\nThe Jets quarterback was injured in the second quarter of Sunday's 24-17 victory over the Baltimore Ravens, and rookie Greg McElroy came off the bench and played well in relief. McElroy completed 13 of 19 passes for 153 yards and a touchdown and was sacked twice.\n\nSanchez said it's not hard to prepare to play in his first game since the injury.\n\n"This is the first week I'm really getting to throw a lot," he said. "I've got to get back into a rhythm. That's what it's about. ... I'm excited. I'm ready to go."\n\nThe Jets have to make a decision on their starting quarterback by Tuesday, when players return from their four-day Thanksgiving break. Coach Rex Ryan said it's not a tough call at this point.\n\n"We'll see," Ryan said. "We've got another day of practice. That's what we've got to look at and see how the situation unfolds.\n\n"If you just look at where he is at this point, he looks good. You look at what Greg did, too. You look at what we did against a good team with a lot of different players."\n\nRyan said the decision to start Sanchez or McElroy has "absolutely nothing to do with any kind of controversy or anything like that. We've got a good quarterback. We know we have two good quarterbacks. You guys want to make this some big controversy, but that's not the case."\n\nMcElroy said he is excited for Sanchez and happy for himself, as well.\n\n"When you have two quarterbacks, you're going to get one of them going," he said. "I'm excited to see Mark back. It's a good thing."
