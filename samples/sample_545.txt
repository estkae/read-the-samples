Bad Experience\n\nby Aileen\n\n(Oklahoma)\n\nThis happened a few years ago when my daughter was about two. It started as a few tantrums in a row, I'd finally find a toy she would be happy with and I'd go get some coffee and a few minutes later I'd hear screaming and I would go back in and she would be throwing the toy or just sitting there crying.\n\n\n\nThis happened for a few weeks, it was almost every day. Then one day she started talking about her friends in a different language. She knew what she was saying was wrong, she was very embarrassed by it.\n\n\n\nShe was saying things like "I hate you." She would also be saying "the cat wants to fight" and stuff like that. At first I just assumed she was mimicking something she had heard but she kept saying things like "can I be in your gang?" Then she started talking about stuff that could only be her imagination. She would say things like "I see your sister getting hit by a car, then a bunch of ghosts are standing around and your dad is talking to them." I was very concerned.\n\n\n\nI talked to the teacher about this and she said she'd been acting really strange in school and talking to her friends and not listening to anyone. She also would draw pictures and be laughing to herself.\n\n\n\nI finally took her to the doctor and she was diagnosed with OCD. They put her on some meds and it cleared up.\n\n
