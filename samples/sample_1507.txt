The Obama administration may have been looking for more than just greater tax revenues when it let banks off with a slap on the wrist for misdeeds leading up to the financial crisis.\n\nOn Monday, a Treasury Department official disclosed that government policy is also to promote diversity in the financial industry.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“The secretary is deeply committed to ensuring that our financial system is not only safer but also more inclusive,” said Mary J. Miller, Treasury’s assistant secretary for financial institutions. “We have made significant progress toward this goal since the financial crisis, and we will continue to take steps to promote diversity.”\n\nThe statement came in an official report to the Senate Banking Committee about the administration’s implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.\n\nThe “other purpose” of the banking industry’s $25 billion legal settlement was to “promote financial stability and inclusive access to financial services,” the Treasury said.\n\nThe disclosure comes on the heels of a New York Times article that criticized the administration for pressuring banks to hire women and minorities.\n\nThe article quoted regulators, who wanted to levy more serious charges against banks for their role in the financial crisis, but were pushed back by political appointees in the White House.\n\nThe Justice Department has received about $37 billion from financial institutions for settling claims related to mortgage-backed securities sold before the crisis, which was the core of the subprime-mortgage crisis.\n\nFederal agencies split the money, with about $9 billion going to the Treasury and the rest to Justice, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).\n\nIt is not clear which regulators were pressuring for the banks to hire more minorities.\n\n“I don’t know where they’re getting their guidance from,” said Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), a member of the House Financial Services Committee. “There is a lot of good, strong, important effort to make sure there is diversity in the financial system. But I can’t tell you it is coming from the administration.”\n\n“I’m not aware of the administration’s influence over these settlements,” Himes said.\n\nAt a hearing on Tuesday, Republicans questioned the diversity reports that the FDIC, the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators prepare to Congress, focusing on the race and gender of the chief executives at banks with more than $1 billion in assets.\n\nThe FDIC’s annual report to Congress, which included the 2012 figures, showed the top 20 chief executives of U.S. banks were white, with five black or African-American CEOs and four Latinos.\n\nHimes said he was happy that the report was made public, even if it didn’t mention the administration.\n\n“I can’t say the administration is the author of the report,” Himes said. “But I can tell you that they are very pleased that the data is out there and the committee is raising the issue.”\n\nSince the financial crisis, there has been a strong focus on expanding minority access to the financial system, with Treasury and the Fed holding annual conferences and offering special programs to reach minority communities.\n\nHimes said that Dodd-Frank was important in making sure minority banks have access to the Federal Reserve’s credit facility, which was not as strong during the crisis.\n\n“I would be very surprised if there were any political pressure exerted on the Fed on this point,” Himes said.\n\nOverall, the banking industry has made significant strides in diversity since the financial crisis, with some Wall Street firms approaching the targets mandated by Dodd-Frank.\n\nMorgan Stanley has more than 30 percent of its executives and managing directors who are minorities or women, and will meet its Dodd-Frank requirement next year.\n\nAt JPMorgan Chase, nearly 23 percent of senior-level executives are women and 15 percent are minorities.\n\nBoth firms are exceeding the overall Dodd-Frank requirement that at least 33 percent of senior-level executives are women or minorities.\n\nThe largest firms have a much higher percentage of senior-level executives, because it is tougher to meet the goals in middle management, where they are struggling to meet the quotas.\n\n“It’s pretty impressive,” Himes said. “They have made great strides and that reflects well on the industry.”
