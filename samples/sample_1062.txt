"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Iran’s oil ministry has started an investigation into one of its officials for suspected corruption in connection with the granting of a major oil development project, Iran’s oil ministry news service Shana reported on Tuesday.\n\nGholam-Reza Manouchehri, the former deputy head of Iran’s South Oil Company, is accused of “corruption” and a ministry spokesman said the probe was a warning that no-one is beyond the law.\n\n“Some people have made the country’s wealth their private property,” said Ali Qanso, spokesman for Iran’s oil ministry.\n\nIranian oil officials rarely face sanctions over corruption in the country.\n\nBut President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Sunday appointed Sadeq Mahsouli, his deputy chief of staff, as acting oil minister in place of Rostam Ghasemi, who was dismissed.\n\nGhasemi is suspected of corruption in the purchase of fuel and faced impeachment by parliament last month.\n\nMahsooli replaces Qassem Soleimani, who was appointed energy minister on Monday. Soleimani will keep his role as commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force, a position he has held since 2007.\n\nThe IRGC is an elite force which runs Iran’s covert operations abroad and is also the main power base of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
