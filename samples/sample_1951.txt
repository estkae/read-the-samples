"Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analyses from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nWorld Jewish Congress president Ronald Lauder, who was set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin on Wednesday, said he would raise concerns about anti-Semitism and Jewish persecution in Russia with the Russian leader.\n\n\n\n“I will stress that the rise of anti-Semitism and attacks on Jews in Russia are alarming,” Lauder said. “We must make clear that these crimes will not be tolerated.”\n\n\n\n\n\nLauder was to meet with Putin at 11 a.m. The meeting is expected to be followed by a lunch with members of the Jewish community and Russian Jewish Congress president Yuri Kanner. The visit is part of a three-day visit to Moscow.Last month, Kanner warned about what he called a “quiet Holocaust” of anti-Semitic attacks in Russia, noting the marked increase in violence against Jewish targets.The Russian-Jewish community in Moscow has seen an increase in anti-Semitic attacks. In a November incident, masked assailants threw Molotov cocktails at a Jewish community center in Moscow, seriously damaging the building.Russian police arrested four suspects, aged 16 to 18, and charged them with hooliganism.Speaking at a ceremony marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day on January 27, Putin said that Russia would “never forget the tragedies of the Holocaust and the heroism of the Red Army” in fighting Nazi Germany.“Today we must not forget the lessons of this horrible tragedy, which our country went through,” he said.“Today, anti-Semitism is being used as a tool to destroy Russia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. This is why it is so important that we continue the effort to instill the values of democracy, freedom, tolerance, and equality, which are the foundation of Russia’s policy.”He added that anti-Semitism, along with xenophobia, racism, homophobia and other forms of intolerance, are unacceptable.Lauder, who visited Russia in May 2015, said at the time that the Russian government had done more than most to facilitate the security of Jewish communities in the country.He praised Putin for leading an international effort to defeat the Islamic State terrorist organization.During a panel discussion in Moscow at the time, Lauder said Putin deserved much credit for his work in securing the removal of the chemical weapons stockpile in Syria from the control of President Bashar al-Assad, where they were being used to kill civilians.Russia, Lauder added, also is making a significant effort to combat anti-Semitism, especially among Russians on the internet.Putin hosted Lauder in December of 2015 when he attended a concert of the Jewish Charity Band in Moscow, where the Russian president showed his knowledge of Jewish customs, telling the audience that challah, the traditional bread eaten by Jews on Shabbat and Jewish holidays, is made with honey, not sugar.
