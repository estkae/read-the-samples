\n\nThe Dunsmuir Viaduct\n\nOne of the most notable features on the Transcontinental Railroad, the spectacular 700-foot high and 2,500-foot long\n\narch bridge that spanned the Sacramento River at Dunsmuir, near the California-Oregon border, was constructed with a\n\ndesign prepared by Theodore Judah, the first president of the Central Pacific Railroad.\n\nInitially, the heavy granite and earthwork masonry bridge was to be built by hand, but the discovery of hydraulic\n\nmining methods nearby soon led to the development of a powerful system for moving earth. (Note that the area\n\naround the bridge is currently undergoing a resurgence of hydraulic mining.\n\nThe Central Pacific had used some 5 million cubic feet of stone for the construction of the famous "Big Four" tunnel\n\nnear Summit, and near Sacramento the new Central Pacific had completed the impressive Red Rock tunnel.\n\nHowever, the sudden availability of cheap power and materials led to the\n\ncompany's decision to abandon plans to build the huge viaduct\n\nby hand, and to simply contract with a well-known contractor\n\nwho had already installed a hydraulicking operation in the\n\nDunsmuir vicinity.\n\nIn addition to the contract for the construction of the viaduct,\n\nWilliam Hammond, the new owner of the hydraulic mining\n\nrights, was to be the contractor of the viaduct construction.\n\nSome of Hammond's rivals were outraged, for they had previously\n\nexpressed their willingness to bid as much as twice as much for\n\nthe contract. Nevertheless, there was apparently no formal\n\nopposition to the awarding of the contract, and in 1867 work\n\nwas begun.\n\nHammond purchased the canyon in 1866 and was granted a special\n\nact of the State Legislature to permit the damming of the\n\nSacramento River and the flooding of the canyon in order to\n\nenable the entire valley to be utilized as a reservoir for\n\nmining purposes. The mining claims were in a variety of hands,\n\nbut Hammond was the biggest individual holder of these rights.\n\nHe started his activities in the canyon in 1865 by building a\n\nwooden flume to transport water to his sawmill. A year later he\n\nbuilt a tunnel to his sawmill, but in 1867 he was employing\n\nover a hundred men at the dam, and at the time of his death in\n\n1867 he was transporting over 70,000 cubic feet of water a day\n\nto his sawmill and to his hydraulic plant.\n\nThe contract for the Dunsmuir Viaduct was let in March 1867.\n\nHammond contracted with Alpheus C. Mason for the construction\n\nof the viaduct. Mason, from Ithaca, New York, had been trained\n\nas a civil engineer and was an experienced hydraulic miner.\n\nHis crew, known as "Mason's White Terrors", was a family operation,\n\nwith both men and women working side by side in the hydraulic\n\nand tunnel operations.\n\nHammond would set up his temporary dam at the tunnel, and\n\nMason would build his temporary roadbed and trestle. As soon as\n\nthe water was let into the tunnel and the dam lowered, Mason's\n\ncrew would be on the site, working feverishly to complete the\n\nviaduct before the flooding of the dam caused the earth to lose\n\nits stability.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawings prepared for the construction of the Dunsmuir Viaduct\n\n\n\n\n\nMason's crew was well versed in building bridges. Working\n\nwith a gang of 700, Mason's gang completed the viaduct in\n\nonly twelve days, and the Central Pacific and Southern Pacific\n\nRailroads began using the viaduct immediately. The viaduct\n\nstill stands today, although since the entire valley is now the\n\nproperty of the state, it is no longer in use for railroad purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. C. Mason\n\nWilliam Hammond\n\nNo official records exist of the cost of the viaduct, but William Hammond's biographer says he spent\n\n$180,000 to construct the viaduct. Other accounts say the cost was about $160,000. The work was\n\ncompleted in less than two months, an incredible feat.\n\nOnly a few years later, William Hammond died, and the amount of money his heirs received was estimated\n\nto be over $3,000,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is Copyright Â© 1995 by Stephen F.
