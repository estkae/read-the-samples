for a lot of reasons. To start, it's the latest blow to the administration's credibility after a litany of controversies, including reports that Trump's campaign aides were in constant communication with Russian intelligence officials during the election.\n\nBut it also illustrates the confusion and infighting that has defined the Trump White House.\n\n"The problem is that, given all the chaos and competing power centers in the White House, it's not clear who is really running the show at any given time," said Ben Rhodes, a former senior foreign policy official under President Barack Obama. "That makes it hard for the administration to have the kind of coherence it needs to conduct a well-organized foreign policy."\n\nFlynn's resignation followed a series of damaging leaks about the president's senior staff and other high-ranking administration officials.\n\nNational security adviser Flynn denied discussing sanctions with Russian envoy\n\nA report published Monday night said top Trump aides, including chief of staff Reince Priebus, White House counsel Don McGahn and press secretary Sean Spicer, kept Trump in the dark about Flynn's conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in order to "protect the president from himself."\n\nIn mid-January, the administration told the Washington Post that Flynn did not discuss the sanctions that the Obama administration imposed on Russia for meddling in the US election. Those sanctions were expected to be a topic of conversation between Flynn and Kislyak, but Pence and other senior officials, including McGahn, were apparently kept out of the loop about what exactly Flynn and Kislyak discussed.\n\nTwo sources familiar with the conversations between Flynn and Kislyak told The Post that Flynn's communications were "incidentally collected" as part of a top-secret intelligence report on Kislyak. After they reviewed the report, which has since been shared with Obama and Trump, McGahn and others acted quickly to warn Trump's senior staff about what they saw.\n\nMcGahn told Trump that Flynn's communications may have violated an obscure US law that forbids private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments against US interests, according to a separate Washington Post report on Tuesday.\n\nIt's not yet clear why Flynn, who was appointed as national security adviser with little experience in international relations, was having those conversations in the first place.\n\nSince the Trump campaign, Flynn has reportedly developed close ties with top officials in Russia, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, and has been paid tens of thousands of dollars in fees by Russian companies.\n\nBut Flynn's resignation on Monday came amid a broader debate over Trump's ties to Russia, and it adds to a cloud of controversy around Trump's own attitude toward Russian meddling in the election. Trump has insisted on several occasions that the intelligence community has not reached a conclusion about whether Russian hackers sought to boost Trump's campaign, even though the intelligence community has reported the consensus view that it was Russia.\n\nDemocrats, in particular, have been vocally critical of Flynn's conversations, and of Trump's defense of Flynn.\n\n"The speed at which we're learning about all of this is absolutely breathtaking," Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Monday. "I think we ought to slow down."\n\n"You can't have a national security adviser misleading the vice president and others," said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat. "This in the wake of what we know about Russian hacking and election interference. It is of profound concern, and there is a need for a serious and thorough investigation."\n\nBut Trump has yet to provide any details about what he believes Flynn discussed with Kislyak.\n\n"I don't think he did anything wrong. If anything, he did something right," Trump said on Wednesday. "He was just doing his job. The thing is he didn't tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn't remember. So either way, it wasn't very satisfactory to me."\n\nWhat is the Logan Act?\n\nIn an interview on Monday, Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, said that Flynn did not discuss sanctions with Kislyak, and that he did not recall discussing the US's decision to expel Russian diplomats from the US in retaliation for the election-related hacking.\n\nWhen The Post first reported on Flynn's conversations in February, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that Flynn had spoken to Kislyak on December 28, the day the Obama administration announced sanctions against Russia for election-related hacking. The sanctions were imposed in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision not to retaliate after the US expelled 35 Russian diplomats and shuttered two Russian facilities in the US in response to the hacking of US political organizations and leaking sensitive information to WikiLeaks.\n\nBut Spicer later walked back that statement, saying that Flynn and Kislyak may have had a conversation, but that it was "not a discussion of sanctions."\n\nThe Department of Justice informed the White House counsel on January 26 that Flynn was not entirely forthcoming about his conversations with Kislyak, according to The Post's first report. A day later, Pence learned that Flynn's conversations may have broken the law and expressed his concerns to Flynn, who assured him they did not.\n\nThe White House said in a statement last week that it had "no idea" about the true nature of the Flynn-Kislyak conversations, but the Post's report on Tuesday said that Trump knew Flynn misled Pence about their contents. Trump did not ask Flynn about it, however, until the Monday before he was fired, the report said.\n\nA person close to the White House told The Post that White House officials were "stunned" to learn how far along the Justice Department investigation was.\n\nAfter The Post's report on Tuesday, which said that Trump had known about Flynn's conversations since January 26, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told CNN that Flynn had Trump's "full confidence."\n\nBut Flynn resigned after a new report published Tuesday night said that the Justice Department had informed the White House that Flynn could be subject to blackmail because of his false statements about his conversations.\n\nFlynn has emerged as a key figure in the ongoing investigations into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, but until recently, the investigation into his activities was limited to whether he had violated federal law by failing to properly disclose payments from Russia and Turkey.\n\nThe federal law that prohibits US citizens from negotiating with foreign governments against US interests, known as the Logan Act, is rarely enforced, but Flynn's conversations with Kislyak could have put him in violation.\n\nThe Logan Act was passed in 1799 to prevent citizens from trying to influence US foreign policy by making private deals with foreign governments. Only two people have been prosecuted under the act: in 1803, when a Kentucky farmer wrote a newspaper article in which he called on Americans to refuse to buy British goods, and in 1852, when an Indiana farmer tried to help Mexican Americans recover lost land after the Mexican-American War. Neither were convicted.\n\nWhen asked about the Logan Act in March, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said it was a "silly" law.\n\n"I don't know what the intent was of the Logan Act, but the law is a little bit silly and a little outdated," he said. "I'd say that his actions -- not just the reporting of the incident -- but also the following day, Flynn made clear that it was inaccurate."\n\nBut one of the US's top legal experts on the Logan Act says that Flynn's actions may be illegal.\n\n"The issue is a very serious one," Stephen Vladeck, a professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law and a CNN contributor, told CNN on Tuesday. "This wasn't just a slip of the tongue. This wasn't just a statement to a reporter. This was something that, according to reports, he discussed with other senior Trump administration officials. It was something that the vice president of the United States apparently thought was serious enough to bring to the attention of the President himself.\n\n"It's not just about the Logan Act. It's about everything else that is swirling around this administration," Vladeck said. "If there is any evidence that the Trump campaign cooperated with Russian officials or representatives to help swing the election, then we have another entirely different kettle of fish on our hands."\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nCNN's Dan Merica contributed to this report.
