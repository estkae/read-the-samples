Interesting info from Mr. Norm Jones at Demographia, who has prepared his own ranking of most/least affordable housing markets in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nNow, there are many many places with far less housing affordability than those shown below. But what I found most interesting is the number of places where the median price for an existing home is in the $250,000 range, which would be considered mid-priced. But it's far, far more than most folks can afford in those markets.\n\nAnd I would argue that's a big part of why the U.S. economy is sluggish, and that's why so many of us in the U.S. and Canada are holding back on our spending plans.\n\nIn those markets shown below, it's a problem for anyone earning less than $200,000 a year. The first couple that jumps out at me is Washington, DC, where even if you earn $200,000, your home payment for a median priced home is going to be around $1,100 per month, and your income would be too high to qualify for a conventional loan for anything under $600,000.\n\nIt doesn't even have to be DC. In San Francisco, the median price for a home is about $760,000, while the average salary is $111,000. The median price for a home in Seattle is $550,000, and average salary is $87,000.\n\nSo people are getting stuck. They are only able to buy a place in a city they can't afford. Or, they're paying well over $200,000 in cash, and are now unable to afford to sell their home and move. Or, they have to move, and in doing so, are now stuck paying rents that are far higher than the same people were paying on their home, and making less money to begin with.\n\nNow, people can debate all day on whether supply is low or demand is high, but in the end, the average income for households is nowhere near the median price for a home in a lot of those places shown below. The markets have grown up around a lack of supply. This is why the D.C. metro area is by far the highest, with an average income of $96,000 and a median price of $420,000.\n\nAnd it's not just one issue. I can't help but think this is a real big factor behind why the U.S. economy isn't really doing all that well, and I think it's something we've got to start addressing as a country. You have very few markets that are both affordable and accessible to most people.\n\nSource: Demographia
