What was supposed to be a funny video was released on a national TV program over a year ago and yet it still doesn't make me laugh. In fact, it makes me want to throw up. This was supposed to be funny.\n\nOne of the biggest issues for me is that it was done with a child. A child that has no voice. If she is the girl I think she is, then she is probably just a teenager and was embarrassed by her mother's stupidity. A lot of the time I have seen these type of videos done by mothers (or sometimes fathers) to embarrass their kids and they usually don't end well. They don't do it to make the child laugh. They do it to make themselves laugh.\n\nThe fact that this mother is in this video says a lot. She is probably the most immature person in this video. I also don't understand how she is teaching her daughter about being "modest." What if the little girl said "I want to be a stripper when I grow up?" Would she have recorded that too? How is she supposed to explain this to her friends and how is she supposed to feel good about herself? This child is not on the verge of adulthood. She is still a child. Her mind is like a sponge.\n\nIf the little girl did in fact ask for a belly button piercing, then I can understand the mother's need to make a video to show her child that she can't do anything she wants. She should have spoken with the little girl about why she doesn't want her to get one and then explained the consequences. Instead she decided to humiliate her in front of the world.\n\nWhen my son was little, he came to me and asked me if he could get his belly button pierced. I didn't answer him right away. Instead, I took him for a walk and explained to him that he was only four years old and I didn't think he was old enough to make that decision on his own. He was OK with it and it never came up again. There was no video made.\n\nThe child in the video may have asked for the piercing and she may not have. No matter what the reason was, I think the mother handled it"
