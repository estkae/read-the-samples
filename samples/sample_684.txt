"British and U.S. officials this week agreed on a plan to halt Iran’s nuclear program by using sanctions and diplomacy, the Times of London reported, citing unnamed senior U.S. officials.\n\nThe plan, which could be implemented in a matter of weeks, will include a dramatic increase in financial sanctions, together with covert sabotage and military action, the newspaper reported, without giving details.\n\nIn Washington, the State Department said it had no comment on the report.\n\nOfficials from both countries are to meet again this week in Washington to discuss further plans, the newspaper said.\n\nThe newspaper, citing unnamed officials, said the new plan would impose a package of sanctions which could see the European Union ban the import of Iranian oil.\n\n“If we have the sanctions come together, then we will be ready to move quickly,” the Times quoted one of the U.S. officials as saying.\n\nU.S. officials said the new plan would incorporate measures drawn up by Israel, which has also urged more sanctions, the newspaper said.\n\nThe Israeli officials told U.S. counterparts they were concerned about the credibility of any sanctions imposed as a result of a plan agreed by the permanent five members of the U.N. Security Council — Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States — but not by other states, the Times said.\n\nThe new plan calls for “the credible threat of military force against the Iranian nuclear program,” it said.\n\nThe plan, drawn up by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, calls for targeted assassinations and for stepping up cyber attacks, it said.\n\nBut the newspaper quoted U.S. officials as saying that even these were unlikely to be effective in stopping Iran’s nuclear program, unless they were accompanied by severe sanctions.\n\nThe United States and its European allies have made several attempts to persuade Iran to stop its uranium enrichment program, which they believe aims to produce nuclear weapons, but Tehran has repeatedly refused.\n\nIran denies the charge, insisting its program is purely civilian.\n\n(Photo: Reuters)
