The map below shows the approximate location of every reported gorilla location between October 2010 and September 2011.\n\nThe red circles show where the gorillas have been reported.\n\nTo see the previous year's map, click here.\n\nMapping gorillas is difficult because of the rugged and thick vegetation in the forests of Congo, where they are found.\n\nOften the trackers do not actually see the gorillas themselves, only hear their distinctive screams, and have to make their estimates based on signs such as footprints and vegetation trampled by the large apes.\n\nHowever, the gorilla range is thought to have expanded significantly in the last five years.\n\nThe good news is that the population is now thought to be in excess of 4,000 gorillas.\n\nThere are many more threats to gorilla survival than loss of habitat, however, and none are yet under control.\n\nThe gorilla is Africa's most threatened mammal, and faces threats from poaching and disease, in addition to the loss of their habitat, and the practice of hunting them for "bushmeat".\n\nThe Rwandan genocide of 1994 also left a terrible legacy, with the influx of refugees leaving a legacy of poaching and poverty.\n\nThe official policy of the Republic of Congo is that all gorillas should be left in peace in their natural habitat, which is now also under pressure from logging.\n\nThe WWF is helping to train a team of gorilla trackers to continue to monitor the gorillas' progress.\n\nYou can support their work by donating to the WWF.
