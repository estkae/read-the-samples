After running out of Kept, I'm trying a different product. Kept's 10:1 CBD oil was just not strong enough for me. I would only be able to use it if I diluted it with another oil. I decided to try another brand, so I bought this 3:1 CBD oil, and is much more reasonable. I think it's more worth the cost to use a stronger product for the same amount of money.
