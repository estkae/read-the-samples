I found an older copy of the Windows NT TCP/IP Stack documentation at the MSDN web site. This was really useful since it describes the more advanced options for tuning the stack. The first thing to change is the default socket buffer sizes for each type of socket. The socket buffer size can be changed for all sockets by using the registry. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DefaultSendWindowSize (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DefaultTTL (DWORD) The TCP/IP Stack has two possible implementations. The default is the ATL implementation. This is the preferred implementation since it has the most current security enhancements. The alternate implementation is the Winsock implementation. It can be accessed using the "Advanced" tab on the "TCP/IP" properties page. There are a couple of different parameters you can adjust in this dialog box. In order to increase the size of the buffers, change the "Send Buffer Size" and the "Receive Buffer Size". By default the send buffer is 4096 and the receive buffer is 8192. If you don't see the "Advanced" tab, you may need to download the Internet Explorer 4.0 patch from the Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource Kit at the MSDN web site. To change the buffer sizes using the registry, use the following information. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\VxD\\MSTCP\\Parameters\\SendBufferSize (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\VxD\\MSTCP\\Parameters\\ReceiveBufferSize (DWORD) This is the maximum size of data that can be sent over a TCP socket. It does not include TCP headers. The default size for this is 65536 (64K). This registry setting can be changed by accessing the Advanced tab on the TCP/IP properties page. The default is a value of 8192. This is the amount of data that can be received by the TCP stack before it is passed up to the protocol layer. The default value is 8192. This is the minimum size of data that can be sent or received by the TCP stack. The default value is 2048. When tuning these parameters, it is important to make sure that the window size is larger than the default size. If not, it will cause the TCP stack to retransmit data. The default is a value of 2048. This registry entry specifies the default maximum receive message size in bytes that a TCP/IP application can receive over a TCP/IP socket. The default value is 16384. This entry specifies the default maximum send message size in bytes that a TCP/IP application can send over a TCP/IP socket. The default value is 16384. This registry entry specifies the maximum size of a receive window in bytes for an application using the Winsock TCP/IP implementation. The default value is 16384. This registry entry specifies the maximum size of a send window in bytes for an application using the Winsock TCP/IP implementation. The default value is 16384. The default value is 4. If you change this value, you should verify that the TCP window size is larger than this value. Otherwise, you may experience retransmission. The default value is 4. If you change this value, you should verify that the TCP window size is larger than this value. Otherwise, you may experience retransmission. There are some registry entries that can be used to tune the TCP/IP stack that have no UI in the Advanced TCP/IP properties page. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DefaultTTL (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\Tcp1323Opts (DWORD) This registry entry specifies the use of the 1323-byte segmentation option. The default value is zero, which specifies that the 1323-byte segmentation option is disabled. This registry entry specifies the use of the ECE (early connection establishment) option. The default value is zero, which specifies that the ECE option is disabled. This registry entry specifies the use of the advanced window scaling option. The default value is zero, which specifies that the advanced window scaling option is disabled. This registry entry specifies the use of the performance options. The default value is zero, which specifies that the performance options are disabled. This registry entry specifies the use of the retransmission timeout. The default value is zero, which specifies that the retransmission timeout is disabled. If you change any of these values, it is very important to verify that the TCP window size is larger than this value. Otherwise, you may experience retransmission. It is also important to make sure that the values of all the parameters are consistent. The following registry entries can also be used to tune the TCP/IP stack, but they don't have a UI in the Advanced TCP/IP properties page. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DisablePMTUDiscovery (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DisablePMTUBHDetect (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DisableRecordRoute (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DisableSelectiveSACK (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DisableSACK (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DisableSACKToSACK (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DisableSelectiveAck (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DisableTimeStamp (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DisableWindowScaling (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_"
