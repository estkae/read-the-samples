"What is the origin of the term fire chief?\n\nNot sure, but I think I can narrow it down to two possibilites. In the days of horse drawn fire engines, the chief was referred to as the horse driver. This was, no doubt, because the chief had the only horse and he, therefore, drove the horse drawn engine. The horse was, of course, critical to the operation of the department, and the chief became known as the fire horse driver. This name was soon shortened to fire chief. Another possibility is that the horse engine driver was called the "fire chief" because he, as an individual, was more important than all the other members of the company. He was in charge and responsible for the well-being of the engine and it's operation.
