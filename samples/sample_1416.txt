The Return of the Living Dead (1985)\n\n(USA)\n\n\n\nOne can only assume that people in the 80s weren’t stupid enough to let actual zombies run amok in their neighborhoods. Or else it would have happened. And it would have been a bigger deal than it is now. A few news stories, a late-night TV scare special, maybe a little outrage, but mostly people would get bored of the topic pretty quickly and move on. But no, the characters in this movie don’t have that luxury.\n\n\n\nThe film opens with a group of kids enjoying a day at the cemetery, presumably as a means to draw out a possible girlfriend/love interest of one of them. One boy brings a portable radio, and an odd transmission is heard coming from it. A moment later, a group of decomposing bodies are rising from the earth. The teens flee to a nearby gas station to use the phone, only to find that the proprietor has been shot by a police officer. They soon realize that there is a zombie outbreak in the area, and that they need to find somewhere safe to ride it out. But the police officers and news crew that are already on the scene won’t leave the gas station. So what’s a few dozen young people to do?\n\n\n\nThe effects in this film are pretty impressive for the era. It was actually one of the first films to use digital compositing for effect. Of course, that meant that they needed to have a steady hand for each frame, since they were limited to four or five exposures. There are some shaky shots, which are all the more noticeable for having been digitally composited. But for the most part, the effects are as good as one could expect, given the budgetary constraints.\n\n\n\nThe acting in this film is really what makes it so interesting. The actors deliver their lines in a pretty serious manner, with very few smiles or other attempts to lighten the mood. The film has a decent sense of humor to it, but it’s not a comedy. I suspect that this may have been part of an effort to avoid the wrath of the MPAA. In 1985, there was no PG-13 rating, but there was an R rating, and that could have really hurt a film’s box office performance. So I imagine that this film may have been forced to tone down some of its humor, if it had any to begin with.\n\n\n\nThis film is a definite success for any horror film, since it wasn’t produced by any of the major studios, and was instead released by TriStar. The film earned a number of Saturn Awards, including Best Horror Film, Best Direction, and Best Special Effects.\n\n\n\nBottom line: this film is a must-watch for any fan of horror films. It is a great film for parties, since it doesn’t take itself too seriously. And it’s short enough to make it a good double feature with any number of other 80s horror films.\n\n\n\nFun fact:\n\nAt the very end of the film, a group of soldiers in hazmat suits arrive at the gas station to take care of the problem. But that was clearly not the intended ending. The ending that was filmed was meant to show the creatures attacking the soldiers, and ending with the discovery that they were infected by the zombies. That ending was deemed to be too graphic for the time, and so the change was made. The cast even shot a second version of the scene, with more characters dressed as soldiers. And then it was discovered that the group was not actually allowed to shoot guns on location, and so the final scene as we see it was filmed. But you can see the director’s cut of the scene at the film’s website, or on the DVD as an extra.\n\n(review originally published on DVD Verdict)
