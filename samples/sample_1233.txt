Maybe he's a local artiste who thinks he can take on the giant OPM icons of old and today. If he is, he'll end up shooting himself in the foot, because a certain Jimmy Bondoc is a man who never loses. And because he's been around for over 30 years, Jimmy Bondoc knows a thing or two about writing songs. Just check out his latest offering, "It's Time To Say Goodnight," which he wrote in a matter of minutes and it was his wife, the singer Wency Cornejo, who made him listen to the song.\n\n"Lagi nasa States ako and she would record me on her iPhone. When I heard this song, I told myself, 'Wow! Galing 'to!' After that, I did my version in the studio and I guess my fans loved it because nasa Spotify ito ngayon," Jimmy shares.\n\nIn a market where love songs are booming, Jimmy's "It's Time To Say Goodnight" stands out, not only because it's sung by Jimmy himself, but also because it's about a relationship that is about to come to an end, for good. "Ikaw ang mahal ko/ pero it's time to say goodnight/ Hindi na masisira ang nakaraan natin/ I wanna thank you for being there," Jimmy sings in the chorus.\n\nJimmy is part of the legendary "Juan For All, All For Juan" group, the group that scored many hits during the '80s, from the Philippine pop classic "Kung Sakali" to the iconic "That's Entertainment," which launched a million and one dance moves. "This is my group, the first OPM group, and we're still here. Our members are in the States now, but every year we get together and perform in the Philippines," Jimmy shares.\n\nHe has his own fan club in the States. "When I perform here, it's sold out every time," he says.\n\nJimmy does get star struck, especially when he meets his old idols, like the late, great Dolphy. "Baka"
