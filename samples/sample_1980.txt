In the beginning, there were lines of force.\n\nIf you were an engineer and looked at a metal rod in a vacuum, you’d see lines of force: blue lines of electric force that crisscross the rod. These lines of force were called “Maxwell’s lines” and there was a specific equation that went along with them:\n\nBut they were invisible. If you look at a metal rod, you don’t see any lines of force crisscrossing it. But if you take that rod and connect it to a generator (or battery), those lines of force become something else: electric field lines. These lines of force, combined with the equation above, are what light is made of. They are the primary concept in light, electromagnetism, and electricity.\n\nBut what does this have to do with art?\n\nAbout 100 years ago, a man named Moholy-Nagy decided to try and see these lines of force. He wanted to give the lines of force a physical form. He wanted to show people what these lines of force looked like and felt like. He wanted to create art about electromagnetism.\n\nThe end result was art that looked something like this:\n\nThe lines of force are simply lines on a canvas. These lines, when electrified, generate light and become a photograph.\n\nFor the past three months, I’ve been playing with a similar idea. I was working with data from HIV research and the raw data consisted of a bunch of numbers. To give those numbers some meaning, I wanted to create art with them.\n\nTo do that, I needed to find a way to generate the data into some sort of form that could be viewed by a human. I decided to work with a technology that was invented around the same time as Moholy-Nagy: video. But unlike Moholy-Nagy, I didn’t want to create a moving image of the data. I wanted to create a still image of the data.\n\nI decided to create an image that looked something like this:\n\nIn this case, the data is what you’d get from a single scan of a microscope. It consists of a bunch of numbers that describe the HIV virus at the cellular level. By using these numbers and displaying them in a visual form, I’m making it easier to understand the virus.\n\nThe data itself is complicated and hard to understand. But the image itself is simple and easily understandable.\n\nThis is what I’ve spent the last few months working on. I’ve been playing with different technologies, seeing which ones could be used to create the image. I’m using some basic information (dimensions, data, etc.) and processing it into something visual. And what I’m seeing is a ton of colors and lines that look something like this:\n\nIn this image, each color represents a different kind of cell. The more of a certain color, the more of that particular cell is found. The lines are just like the lines of force. If the line is thick, it means there’s a lot of that particular cell. If it’s thin, it means there’s less of that particular cell.\n\nThe above image, by the way, is an image of the HIV virus. The data itself was taken from a paper by Jason Gestal and Monica Malvezzi. I used an algorithm to convert their data into the image above.\n\nMy end goal is to get the image above to look something like this:\n\nThe above image was taken by Eran Hodis at MIT. It shows the formation of HIV in real time. The colors represent different cellular markers (the same as the ones above), while the lines represent time. The HIV virus starts to form at the top of the image. It slowly moves down, changing in shape as it goes. It’s incredible to look at.\n\nThis is what I’m working on now. I want to create my own image of HIV that’s as incredible as Eran’s. To do that, I need to convert the data into something visual. To do that, I need to understand how the data should be visualized. To do that, I’m going to need some help from people more talented than myself.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more, or working on this project, email me at dylan@hiv.colorado.edu.\n\nYou can also follow along on Twitter: @coloradoHIV.
