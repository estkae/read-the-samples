The drama of the week is all about the inability of a local physician to get paid by insurance companies. It is not an uncommon story in that many physicians cannot get paid by insurance companies for a variety of reasons. The difference in this story is that this physician not only tried to get paid, but took the insurance company to court to try to get paid.\n\nIt started when a physician sent an invoice to an insurance company for services rendered. The physician was told that the insurance company did not have the funds to pay the invoice and that they would pay the bill at a later date. The physician sent the insurance company a bill every month for about a year until the insurance company stopped communicating. The physician was then advised by a collection agency that if he wanted to be paid, he would have to take the insurance company to court.\n\nThe physician then did just that. He filed a claim with the District Court seeking the unpaid bill plus interest and costs. The insurance company tried to have the case dismissed by claiming the physician did not have standing to sue. The insurance company argued that the physician only had a contractual right to be paid, but that right had not been breached. They also argued that he could not have been damaged by their failure to pay since it was their money.\n\nThe physician won the case. He was awarded the $10,600 plus interest and costs. The judge agreed that the insurance company breached the contract when it failed to pay the bill. The judge also found that the insurance company's withholding of payment did cause the physician to suffer damages in the form of legal fees to pursue payment.\n\nAs for the insurance company, it is probably a good idea that they got caught. Since their contract was breached and they caused damages, they may be liable for punitive damages which could double the amount of the doctor's claim.
