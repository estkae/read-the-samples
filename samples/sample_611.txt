\n\n\n\nFor a long time I've been a huge fan of the wedding ring with the skull and crossbones. It started with a skull ring I purchased in Japan and has been a love of mine ever since. Last week, I purchased my first matching set of skull and crossbones wedding rings from Etsy.\n\n\n\n\n\nI will be able to wear them as a set with my diamond wedding band, or I can switch them out and wear them separately. I love that versatility.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have a favorite ring?\n\n\n\n
