The beach\n\nNew Year’s Eve party\n\nNew Year’s Day party\n\nThe beach is the number one attraction of Rio Grande do Sul. Each day we celebrate the weather, going to the beach in the morning and afternoon. During the evenings we celebrate the seasons of the year in winter we sit around the fireplace, while in summer we dance around the bonfire. In summer we dance samba in the streets of Santa Catarina, in Rio Grande do Sul, in the middle of the city, in the suburbs, in the mountains, at the beach and on the hills. At night we can enjoy live music in one of the many bars of Santa Catarina. You can find bars and clubs that play regional music, national music, world music and, in many cases, international music. If you are an extroverted person, there is no better place than Santa Catarina.
