So how did you survive the terrible British summer of 2015? (Mine was miserable. There were too many weekends at home in the garden, that's all I can say.) Well, it's a new year and a new season of Doctor Who, with Peter Capaldi as our time-travelling hero.\n\nHere's the first photo of Capaldi in costume:\n\nAnd here's how it all begins...\n\nThis story is called The Magician's Apprentice and features Missy (the Master, if you didn't know).\n\nAnd here's a trailer:\n\nAll we can say is: A spooky church? The Doctor having to answer questions about his mistakes? Yes, please! We can't wait to see more.\n\nDoctor Who series 9 begins on Saturday 19 September on BBC One.
