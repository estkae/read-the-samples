TAMPA, Fla. -- The Yankees will welcome back a familiar face this weekend when outfielder Jacoby Ellsbury starts in left field Friday against the Mets at Citi Field.\n\nEllsbury, who has been sidelined since Sept. 11 due to a dislocated right shoulder, said he's ready to get back on the field.\n\n"I'm excited," Ellsbury said Wednesday morning. "Excited to be back, looking forward to it."\n\nIn the Yankees' 11-1 win over the Rays on Wednesday night, Ellsbury went 1-for-2 with a walk in his first rehab game with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.\n\n"It's great to see the ball come off the bat and see the work is paying off," Ellsbury said of watching the game on TV. "I felt great today, so I'm looking forward to doing more of that."\n\nEllsbury had been taking grounders at first base, but manager Joe Girardi said he'll return to left field when he returns to the big leagues.\n\nGirardi, however, is uncertain if Ellsbury will take his first major league at-bat of the season Friday night.\n\n"We'll see. We haven't talked about it yet," Girardi said.\n\nEllsbury admitted he's been eager to get back on the field.\n\n"It was tough, honestly," he said of the shoulder injury. "I'm a competitor. I want to be out there. I want to play, but there was nothing I could do. I was trying to do the best I could, and I was playing hurt, obviously."\n\nEllsbury, who won a Gold Glove in 2014, believes he's playing at an All-Star level once again.\n\n"I felt like I was playing at a pretty good level, at an All-Star level for the first half of the year, for sure," he said. "And obviously, I know what I can do, so that's the goal. To get back to that level."\n\nOf course, the Yankees' outfield has changed quite a bit since Ellsbury last played. Aaron Judge was called up on Aug. 3 and became an instant fan favorite, and Tyler Austin, who is currently in the lineup against the Rays, has taken over in left field.\n\n"I'm just here to help," Ellsbury said. "It's a good young group here. They're playing well. They're playing hard. It's a great group, so I'm just here to help."
