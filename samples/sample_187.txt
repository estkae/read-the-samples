"One of my best friends, Rachel, is pregnant and is due in April, so of course I had to make her something. She loves to read, so I made her a book gift! It has 2 to choose from; The Mad Tea Party by Lauren Child and Mary Poppins.\n\nI used the Victoria Plum and The Grey from the Victoria Plum fabric line.\n\nI found the bookmarks at a scrapbooking store and thought they were adorable.\n\nI wish I could remember where I found the quote, I think I searched Etsy and bought it there.\n\nI thought it would be cute to make little tags to put the names on so she could just hand them out.\n\nI love the bright colors on the back!\n\nThank you for looking!
