Classical /C.S. - Posted: 09/10/2004 Why the hip-hop artist and the jazz composer both came to admire Liszt and Wagner\n\n\n\nCarl Czerny, the 19th century virtuoso who could do 100,000 scales in one session, wrote an excellent piece called 'School of Velocity'. And yes, it was about the velocity of execution - but there was a lot more to it.\n\n\n\nThe idea was that when you learned a piece you should practise it very slowly, in order to get the fingering, phrasing, pedalling etc right. But once you could play the piece perfectly slowly, you needed to practise it more quickly, in order to make sure you got the fingering, phrasing and pedalling absolutely perfect at the quicker speed.\n\n\n\nCzerny practised every day for hours, he wrote over two thousand pieces for piano (many are now completely forgotten) and he was a friend of Beethoven and of the pianist and composer Franz Liszt. The School of Velocity actually explains a lot about Czerny and Liszt's tastes in music. It wasn't so much about technique - though obviously they wanted music that was extremely difficult to play, and music that sounded good at every speed. But it was also about a music that is rhythmically and intellectually complex. Music that sounded fine, and was fascinating, at any speed.\n\n\n\nIn the 19th century, composers and performers used to refer to a piece that was difficult to play as being 'virtuoso' music. Today, people are much more likely to say that a piece is 'virtuoso' if the performer is a brilliant soloist. There was an important link between the two ideas, but there was also a big difference.\n\n\n\nA piece might be virtuoso in the sense that it was musically hard to play. But if a soloist could play the piece perfectly well, then there was nothing virtuosic about it at all. You could hear that it was musically good - but it wouldn't sound difficult.\n\n\n\nI remember a performance of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring that I saw in the early 1970s, when I was a teenager. It was performed by a major orchestra with some top conductors, and it was an extremely well-rehearsed performance. It was also a pretty stodgy performance - there was no electricity, and hardly any excitement. It was an impressive feat, but it was also dull. The most memorable thing about the performance was the way the audience reacted to it - the British critics, who thought they were being sophisticated, sneered and scoffed, and the audience members, who hadn't really understood what they had just seen, shouted and cheered.\n\n\n\nSo I know very well that a piece can be virtuoso in the sense that it is musically exciting - and yet it can also be virtuoso in the sense that it is technically extremely hard to play. I also know that the relationship between the two is not straightforward.\n\n\n\nA well-played piece can be musically exciting, and yet the performer can miss out on all the virtuoso bits - they can play it slowly, without pedalling, and without any expression, and without making any effort to bring out the music. If you think about it, that can't be right. If a piece is technically easy to play - and musically boring - then it isn't really a virtuoso piece. It may be musically good - but it's not virtuoso.\n\n\n\nThere is a lot more to virtuosity than just playing a piece well. And you can tell that from some of the best music ever written.\n\n\n\nSo Liszt and Czerny's criteria for virtuoso music aren't the same as the criteria for 'musical virtuoso' music. To them, it was also about a sense of musical excitement. It was about a piece that sounded good at any speed - and which sounded good whether you played it fast or slow. In the 19th century, that was what virtuosity was about.\n\n\n\nThat's why they liked Liszt and Wagner so much. And that's why I like them too.\n\n\n\n<< Music & Vision home A musician's life >>\n\n
