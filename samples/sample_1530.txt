"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A man drove a truck into a crowd in the German city of Munich on Friday evening, killing at least nine people in what police said appeared to be a deliberate attack.\n\nThe suspected driver was a German, a police spokesman said. The nationality of the dead was unclear. The official asked not to be named.\n\nPolice in the southern state of Bavaria, where Munich is located, said on Twitter they were treating the incident, which also left several people seriously injured, as an act of terrorism. They could not confirm reports of a gun being fired.\n\nGerman television stations carried a photograph of a large truck with its windshield smashed out on the pavement alongside bodies covered in blankets.\n\n"The situation is still chaotic," the police spokesman said.\n\nThe incident happened at about 5:50 p.m. (1650 GMT) at a busy time near a Munich subway station.\n\nAmbulances and heavily armed police rushed to the scene.\n\nThe police statement said the truck ploughed into people on the busy shopping street.\n\n"The van drove into the crowd. That's what we can say," police spokeswoman Claudia Kuenzel told reporters.\n\nU.S. government security officials have been warning their citizens in Germany to keep a low profile and be alert for the possibility of terrorist attacks, according to a State Department cable.\n\nA State Department travel warning in effect since June said there was "credible information" that Islamic State, al Qaeda and their affiliates were planning attacks in Europe, especially Germany.\n\nThe area of the incident was very near the venue of the 1972 Olympic Games which were hosted by Munich.\n\nPolice in the southern German city of #Munich say they are treating incident as a terror attack https://t.co/K0ftHwvLEd pic.twitter.com/zkQpMw1QNZ â€” BBC Breaking News (@BBCBreaking) December 22, 2016\n\n(Reporting by Madeline Chambers, Victoria Bryan, Paul Carrel and Tina Bellon; Writing by Madeline Chambers and Joseph Nasr; Editing by Gareth Jones and Alison Williams)
