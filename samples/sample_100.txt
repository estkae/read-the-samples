"Considered a New York classic, the Fourth Avenue Deli has been a staple of the city’s Lower East Side for decades. Deli aficionados and tourists alike have been lining up outside the restaurant’s doors for more than 50 years, eagerly awaiting their first taste of Katz’s famed pastrami sandwich. Katz’s special blend of spices, smoked over pinecones in traditional ovens, and the deli’s commitment to quality meat make the perfect recipe for mouthwatering pastrami. Every bite of the succulent, slow-cooked meat is an explosion of flavors.\n\nKatz’s pastrami, made with fatty beef from the belly, is a little softer than that of the more common brisket, but has a much richer, beefier flavor. The deli also offers hot pastrami, which is much more spicy than its cold counterpart. But it’s Katz’s hearty slices of hand-carved corned beef, a delicacy with a history dating back to the 1700s, that has helped make the deli a household name.
