It is not man-made knowledge, but it is the knowledge that is given to you through the Spirit of God. It is the knowledge that has been with you since before time. It is knowledge that is deeper than your knowledge. It is the knowledge that even those who have forgotten the Knowledge of God still have within them, and it is the knowledge that Jesus had, and that you have in Christ.\n\nKnowledge of the mind is from the intellect and knowledge of the body is from the senses."
