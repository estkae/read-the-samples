Getty Images\n\nThe most decorated soccer club in Europe with a dozen English Premier League titles is on the brink of extinction, according to new reports out of England.\n\nAn investigation by British newspaper The Times says Manchester United is currently trying to find the money to avoid missing a bond interest payment due on July 14, which could lead to a default on the more than $800 million the team owes in loans. The loans are used to pay for a debt pile the team built up when its owners, the Glazer family, bought the team in 2005 in a deal that saddled the team with more than $800 million in debt.\n\nThe U.S. owners are using the money to pay down that debt, according to the report, while looking for an investor to help the team, which is currently a distant second in the EPL behind Chelsea.\n\nFor its part, Manchester United officials called the report inaccurate, saying in a statement that the team has no plans to default. The team has declined to comment further.\n\nManchester United didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThat's not the only drama affecting the team right now. The team's star striker, Wayne Rooney, is reportedly trying to get out of his contract with the team by arguing that he was misled when he signed a deal in 2010 that will pay him $25.6 million a year through 2019.\n\nThe team will have to sell Rooney to recoup his current contract if he gets a court to agree to the argument.\n\nFor more on the British soccer team's troubles, check out the full report at The Times.
