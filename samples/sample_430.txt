4.25 stars - Review by Trisha\n\n\n\nIn my experience, most male-on-male romance books are really hot and steamy but the storyline is lacking, but this one definitely surpassed my expectations. This book wasn't hot and steamy. Not even a little bit. There was one sexy scene between Jay and Davey but that was about it. But it was such a great story. The storyline kept me interested the whole time and I was really rooting for them to have their happily ever after.\n\n\n\nDavey just recently moved from Ireland to get away from his family and the drama that comes with them. He loves working at a video game store and is really happy there. He has a steady boyfriend but that doesn't mean that Davey is 100% out of the closet. Jay is his friend from work but Davey doesn't know that Jay is in love with him.\n\n\n\nJay is totally in love with his best friend Davey. He thinks that Davey is perfect but he can tell that Davey is hiding something. Davey has a hard time trusting people and Jay doesn't know why. But Jay can tell that Davey is hiding something so he just decides to wait it out until Davey is ready to tell him. He's hoping that one day, Davey will realize that Jay is in love with him and he will finally be able to be with the man he loves.\n\n\n\nI really liked the characters. I felt really bad for Davey and how his family was treating him. I also really liked Jay. He was such a great guy. He was just really honest about his feelings for Davey. And I loved that about him.\n\n\n\nIt was a really great story. I loved the characters, I loved the storyline, and I was really rooting for these two to be together.
