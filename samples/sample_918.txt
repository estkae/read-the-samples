It was James’ first game against New York since last year’s playoffs.\n\nJ.R. Smith scored 19 points, Courtney Lee had 17, and Kristaps Porzingis finished with 14 points and seven rebounds. The Knicks have lost five straight.\n\nJames had six assists and made 11 of 16 field goals in 33 minutes. He was a game-time decision because of soreness in his left knee.\n\n“It feels great. It feels good,” James said. “To be able to finish the game, play 32 minutes, not have any setbacks. … I could have gone back in. Coach wanted me to rest a little bit. I got some"
