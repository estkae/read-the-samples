him?\n\nHe is the person that I love.\n\nHe is the person that I love?\n\nI am.\n\nI have said it already.\n\nIf you have an interest in him, I'll disappear right away.\n\nI'm not up to that.\n\nI'm not up to it.\n\nWhat do you mean you're not up to it?\n\nYou've said a lot of things that\n\nI am not understanding at all.\n\nWhat's this?\n\nYou told me that you have\n\na reason to be angry.\n\nI don't understand why you are angry.\n\nWho do you want to say that I am angry at?\n\nYourself.\n\nMe?\n\nYou are the person who has said\n\nthat I have not made any effort\n\nin trying to be friends with you.\n\nYou have already said that\n\nbut I didn't accept that.\n\nWhy didn't you accept it?\n\nI don't know why.\n\nYou were wrong.\n\nBecause I'm not the person that you think I am.\n\nThen who

sure.\n\nIf I tell her that I like her\n\nand she doesn't understand that\n\nthen it could be very dangerous.\n\nI don't want to have any problems\n\nwith her.\n\nShe is a girl.\n\nShe has her own life.\n\nI don't want to hurt her.\n\nMaybe you are wrong.\n\nMaybe you are wrong.\n\nMaybe you shouldn't talk to her.\n\nWhat do you mean maybe I shouldn't talk\n\nto her?\n\nWhy?\n\nYou shouldn't
