I\n\ndon't get it.\n\n\n\n\n\nis everything these guys touch...\n\na new invention?\n\na revolutionary process?\n\non the cutting edge?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I first started using liquid eyeliners a few years ago I thought,\n\nthey look good...\n\nthey look like they'd be fun to play with.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd,\n\ndang,\n\nthese pencils are kind of expensive...\n\n\n\n\n\nI think they may be well worth the money.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever,\n\nthe lady who taught my eyeshadow class at Ulta did recommend the following liquid eyeliners:\n\n(she did not recommend them to me personally - just to class members in general)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been using the NYX and Essence eyeliners.\n\nNYX for a while now.\n\nThis is a good one.\n\nEssence - the new one.\n\nThe applicator is much easier to work with.\n\nAnd this one is super black.\n\nI still can't get my line to look as good as it does on the Ulta lady -\n\nbut I'm practicing.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's an in-your-face look:\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm also playing with a new look...\n\none with a slight wing.\n\nIt's easier to wear than it is to do,\n\nand it takes a long time to get it right.\n\nBut it's not rocket science.\n\nAnd it's fun.\n\nI guess I need to work on my penmanship.\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for reading,\n\n\n\n\n\nDana
