His life is changed forever when he and his mother are abducted by sea raiders.\n\n\n\nMaureen Hancock's Gift of the Gods is based on the Greek myths and a thoroughly modern sensibility. Her hero is Perseus, a prince of Argos, whose life is changed forever when he and his mother are abducted by sea raiders. Wrenched from his idyllic home and beloved mother, Perseus is taken into slavery by the king of an island at the edge of the world. Here he meets other boys, and among them one boy in particular who will become his best friend. Separated from his mother, surrounded by enemies, and frightened for his life, Perseus must learn to survive, to fight, to be ruthless if necessary, and most of all, to overcome his fear and self-doubt.\n\n\n\nWhen the king of his adopted land asks him to return a favor he's done him, Perseus begins his adventure as he sets sail on the first of many dangerous voyages. In the course of his travels, Perseus will visit the far-flung corners of the known world: he will be shipwrecked on a distant island, captured by an exotic queen, befriend the gods, and battle sea monsters. Most of all, he will learn who he is and what he can accomplish when he relies on his own courage and strength, and the gifts the gods have given him.\n\n\n\n\n\nCategoría Sub-Categoría Juvenil Juvenil - Literatura Juvenil\n\nISBN 13:\n\n9780895983766\n\nISBN 10:\n\n0895983769\n\nFormato:\n\nPapel Delgado (Paperback)\n\nIdioma:\n\nInglés\n\nPáginas:\n\n171\n\nTamaño:\n\n8.50" l x 5.50" w x 0.80" h\n\nEdades:\n\n9 - 12\n\nGrado:
