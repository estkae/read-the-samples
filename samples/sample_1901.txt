My best friend, my very dearest and best friend in the whole wide world, is five and a half years old. I’ve been friends with him since he was about two and a half. He’s such a sweet and wonderful boy, he deserves all of the love in the world.\n\nEvery single day he gives me something new to treasure, and makes my life so much richer and better. He’s silly and adorable and fun. I love him to pieces. He’s just an amazing little person and he’s definitely the smartest five and a half year old I know.\n\nWe talk about everything together, and I love that he knows that I love him. I always tell him that I love him and I hope that he knows that I mean it. I’m not sure that he does. I don’t know if he feels that way about me, but I know that I love him and he means the world to me. He always says he loves me, but I can’t tell if he knows what that means.\n\nI want him to know that he’s loved. I want him to know that I’m his friend and that he can talk to me about anything. I love listening to him tell me about his day. He always tells me the best stories, and I’m happy that I can be there for him. I think he’s amazing and I hope he knows that I think so.\n\nI’m sure that one day he’ll love me like I love him. He’ll love me enough that I can tell that he loves me. He’ll love me enough that I can tell that he appreciates my love for him. He’ll love me enough that I can tell that he wants me to be his friend.\n\nI just hope he knows that I love him.
