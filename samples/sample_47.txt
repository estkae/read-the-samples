Mastering financial knowledge and planning for a good life is a lifelong process. But when it comes to money, how many people have the knowledge to plan for a good life? And what if you had this information, would you use it? How would you live? Would your life change for the better? Would your relationships improve? Would your life be happier?\n\nIn most cases, we don’t have enough financial knowledge to make the right decisions. We don’t have the knowledge and therefore, we end up making bad decisions.
