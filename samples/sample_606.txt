Okay, okay...they didn't actually catch the first fish I photographed today. But I didn't get a photo of the one they caught, so this one will have to do!\n\n\n\nWe have gone fishing every Saturday morning for about a month now. I'm hoping the kids will be bored of it soon so I can take photos of other things. I'm especially hopeful that I'll get the chance to get some photos of the famous monk parakeets that live in the trees near the lake!\n\n\n\nAnyway, I caught up with the fishing this morning (the photos were taken over the course of the past month) and realized that I have actually been writing these up in reverse order! Oops. Sorry! But it's too late to go back and re-order the blog so they'll stay as they are.\n\n\n\nAnyway, it was a very nice day to go fishing! (and the kids had a great time!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
