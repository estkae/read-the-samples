Culture of Empathy: Bats and Bells\n\nCulture of Empathy: Bats and Bells\n\nYou are likely familiar with the cultural myths surrounding the bat, often involving vampires and bloodsuckers, evil demons or even winged creatures that steal one’s soul. In the Western world, the bat has for centuries, and for many people even today, been associated with negativity and danger.\n\nThe bat, on the other hand, is a highly empathetic creature. Bats have amazing social connections and perform complex rituals that ensure the welfare of their group members. They are amazing hunters of both insects and fruit, thanks to their very good eyesight and a large brain for processing data. Because of their social abilities and prey-catching skills, the bat has been hunted and killed.\n\nAccording to the Bats of Trinidad and Tobago website, “Since bats are prey for many animals, the loss of bat populations due to predation is widespread. Predatory birds and snakes, for example, may take a large number of bats from a colony.”\n\nI often wish for such care, consideration and connection when I’m interacting with other people. I often wonder what it would be like to have relationships built on respect, reciprocity and trust. My hope is that someday all the people in the world will connect with their hearts and brains, and practice empathetic responses to others.\n\nThough a long time ago, I have even heard the birds and bats say…\n\nCome on baby, light my fire.\n\nI wanna be burned, and baby, then you’ll desire.\n\nTo my readers, I’d like to introduce a new piece of music that I recorded on a ukulele. I’m not sure if I’ve mentioned this before, but my instrument of choice is the ukulele. I’ve been studying classical guitar for a few years and I’m not so sure I’ll ever play anything other than the uke.\n\nThe song I am introducing is a tune that came to me as I was studying bats for my Culture of Empathy book. I was curious to learn more about the bat’s in Trinidad and Tobago.
