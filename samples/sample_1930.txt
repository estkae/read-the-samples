It’s been a little over a week since the Champions League Final in Madrid, and the dust is just starting to settle on the fallout of it all. For me, I think I’m still in a state of ‘what just happened?’, that’s for sure. What was meant to be a triumphant end to my #UCL32 project (see my write-up here) has instead become an experience I’d really rather forget, thanks in part to Liverpool Football Club.\n\nI’ve done a bit of reading online about the debacle that went down at the end of the match and after reviewing some footage from the stands, it was crystal clear that a mistake was made by VAR, resulting in an unfair goal to Real Madrid, which ultimately led to them lifting the trophy. And, it doesn’t matter who is to blame for that or who is to blame for that mistake – it’s irrelevant now. This result has completely altered the perception of the match, and in the aftermath, everyone involved has received widespread criticism.\n\nIt’s not right to blame the referee, the assistants, VAR or UEFA for what happened – everyone involved did their best with the information and the situation at hand. So, in my view, Liverpool supporters (and, I know I’m not alone in this) should not be directing their ire towards any of them. Instead, it should be directed solely and squarely towards the players, who once again, failed to deliver on the biggest stage of them all. This is one time, I’m happy to say, that we (Liverpool supporters) got what we deserved – our team fell flat on their faces and to top it off, to be held responsible for this nonsense and face the criticism that we have is just a joke.\n\n“Everybody makes mistakes, VAR included” – the way the linesman or anyone else on the field could possibly say this is totally unacceptable is beyond me. How is it a mistake for VAR to fail to overturn a mistaken decision? This is the point where Liverpool supporters should be raging. VAR is meant to prevent this sort of thing from happening – to clear up these kinds of mistakes. If we can’t rely on VAR to make the right decision, then what’s the point?\n\nThe best thing that I can do is try and forget about it and move on. If I’m honest, I never felt we had much of a chance against Madrid, to be honest. I thought that they were just too good. After the game, we have to accept that Madrid are deserved champions and it’s time to take a look at ourselves, what we’ve done and what we can learn from this season.\n\nAs I’ve written elsewhere, I’ve no doubt that Liverpool will be back next season to challenge again. The overall playing quality in this squad is not what it was last season, however. That’s not to say that it isn’t very high – we saw how good the team is this season, despite the off-pitch distractions. However, it is just a fact that when you lose your best players and you don’t replace them adequately, then you’re going to be on the receiving end of the stick. In that sense, Klopp and the players have no one to blame but themselves for this season’s failure.\n\nThe Good\n\nNot a lot to say here. We’ve already spoken about how good the team was in this season’s Champions League, so it’s just as well that the good is minimal.\n\nThe Bad\n\nIn terms of the bad, it’s a lot to say, so here goes…\n\nThe team’s failure to show up on the biggest stage when it really mattered.\n\nWe didn’t score in the final for the first time in this season’s competition.\n\nWe conceded an own goal for the first time in this season’s competition.\n\nWe were beaten on the scoreboard by the eventual winners for the first time in this season’s competition.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van D"
