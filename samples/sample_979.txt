"Is he your boyfriend?"\n\nI'd been asked this question before, and with almost each inquiry I replied with a bemused, and often annoying, "Why would he be?" But with this girl I laughed and said, "Yes."\n\nIt was not only because I'd heard a story about her but because she was interesting. She had a big personality, a keen sense of humor, and a voice that could give a mountain a sore throat. She also gave off a vibe that made me want to jump into her car, and I would have, had she offered.\n\nThe story I'd heard about her was that she had tried to commit suicide by lighting herself on fire. When a police officer approached her and said, "Put the lighter down, honey," she allegedly replied, "Fuck you, motherfucker, don't call me honey."\n\nI was fascinated by her. Not because of her attempted suicide, which I am empathetic toward, but because she was so many different things, and I wasn't sure if she was real.\n\nSo I invited her to the party I was attending, and when she said she couldn't make it, I asked her if she wanted to go to dinner and a movie instead. She said yes, and we hung out a few more times, but it never really went anywhere.\n\nI think the girl at the gas station was the only woman I really didn't like at the time. The reason I had a hard time being her friend was because I couldn't be her friend. I had to be her boyfriend, or she would want to be my girlfriend, and I was still hung up on the girl from school.\n\nWhen you are a teenager, you think everyone you meet has a secret agenda.\n\nYou don't realize you are a person, you are a type. And the type is the kind of person you are looking for. When someone crosses that line, they stop being a person and they become a situation.\n\nFor the next three years, I was in that situation.\n\nI liked this girl, this type of girl, because she didn't know how to not be attracted to me.\n\nI liked her because I knew I had power over her.\n\nI liked her because she was vulnerable.\n\nI liked her because she was scared.\n\nI liked"
