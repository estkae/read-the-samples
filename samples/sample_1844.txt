Dec 2, '12\n\nI know when I was pregnant I was extremely worried about getting a spinal tap, but it wasn't that bad. I also got an IV on each arm because of gestational diabetes. They told me I had to get the spinal tap in the office, so I wasn't able to walk around. The nurse that did it did it on my left side (she told me it was because that's the stronger side). It was very quick and painless, and I actually started crying afterwards because I was so happy. I was being very emotional the whole time I was pregnant (which was most of my pregnancy).
