Khevron\n\n(Tollerman)\n\nI think it's best not to be a part of this kind of mess and just let everyone do what they want with it.\n\nI really don't care how you decide, because I probably won't be playing with you again.\n\nYou say I made you quit... but you didn't have to quit the clan because of me.\n\nNo, I didn't care if you quit or not. I just said it'd be cool if you didn't quit.\n\nAnyways, I probably won't be on as much, so I won't be seeing you guys again.\n\nI'll be playing CS:S probably.\n\nLaterz\n\n\n\n\n\nI understand that what I said last night may have been misconstrued, but what I was saying was that you're making things seem more personal than they really are.I didn't care about what you did or didn't do. I was just saying it would be cool if you didn't quit, since it's no fun without people to play with.But if you're going to quit anyway, it's not my business. That's what I was trying to say. And don't worry about this being a "mess", it's not really that important in the grand scheme of things. Just try to do what you think is best, I guess.
