The Heart of America Chapter of NAMI has been working hard over the last few years on a very important goal. We are working toward a “No Violence Alliance” which will include the five counties in our chapter and include an understanding that we are one family with shared goals. The way that it will work is that each county in our chapter will create a planning committee and then work to develop a local plan with several goals to create a no violence alliance.\n\nWe have had some great success in the last few years. We have helped local officials understand mental health and the need to work with it in developing better strategies in the community. We have helped our communities create mental health courts, and have worked to reduce jail time for those suffering from mental illness. We have worked to improve treatment and medications for those suffering from severe mental illness, and we have made great strides in understanding the stigma of mental illness.
