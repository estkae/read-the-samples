It’s like it was made by a fairy.”\n\nIt was a food that only Muyoung could make.\n\nAn extravagant food that is only made once a month.\n\n‘This is one of the reasons why I could fight against Asura.’\n\nA special type of food that required cooking skill rank B and a special ingredient.\n\nHe needed to work a bit harder if he wanted to make it again.\n\nThe fire tar’s meat was a rare ingredient that only a few thousand had in the entire Underworld.\n\nFire tars were similar to Muyoung’s Clan.\n\nIf it was used as a material, it could greatly increase the effect of a medicinal plant.\n\nOnly fire tars that are bigger than an orc and have lived longer than 100 years could eat this soup and live.\n\nA food that was fit for kings.\n\nAlthough Woohee would recover a bit every day with just the broth, this dish was able to raise her abilities to a whole new level.\n\nIt was because her wings that were cut off were regenerating bit by bit.\n\n“Is there anything else that you need?”\n\n“Nope. I feel like I could live a bit longer after eating this.”\n\n“Then, it’s a good thing.”\n\nMuyoung slowly drank his soup.\n\nWoohee was sitting right next to him.\n\nIt was an extremely awkward position but Muyoung pretended not to see it and kept drinking his soup.\n\nWoohee wasn’t the only one who needed this food.\n\nBae Sungmin and Taehwan were recovering their physical strength.\n\n‘It was worth it.’\n\nMuyoung did have his hesitations about joining the Fire Tars.\n\nBut in the end, it was definitely worth it.\n\nMuyoung felt relieved after getting the compensation.\n\nBut it wasn’t just about the compensation.\n\n‘We are able to proceed a lot more smoothly now.’\n\nThe second reward that Muyoung was going to receive would also be delivered.\n\nIf he knew how to use the Fire Tars properly, he could easily increase his power a lot more than he could imagine.\n\nHe was planning to proceed slowly, bit by bit.\n\nThe goal of this plan was to create the best
