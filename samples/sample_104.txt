Court rules out taking blood samples for cell phone surveillance\n\nIn the United States, the Supreme Court ruled out taking blood samples for cell phone surveillance, the second verdict in just a few days.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Washington (USA) ruled that the police is not allowed to search a person's body for a cell phone's location and information.\n\nIt was decided in a 4-to-3 vote. This is the second verdict in a week in which the Supreme Court ruled that blood samples must not be taken from a person arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.\n\nAccording to the relevant law, the police can take a blood sample for alcohol from an arrested person if there are grounds for suspicion. It also specifies that if a person refuses, they can be forcibly taken.\n\nA man was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in 2011. He was ordered to give blood samples. He refused, but the police took the samples forcibly. The court found out that the defendant was under the influence of alcohol. He appealed, but his appeal was rejected in 2012. He then appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn a 4-to-3 vote, the Supreme Court overturned the verdict and ordered the verdict to be re-tried.\n\nIn the meantime, the verdicts are difficult for police. They can't take blood samples from suspects in alcohol-related accidents, nor take blood samples of suspected drug addicts, nor use DNA to find out the suspects in rape cases. They have to be very careful about searching people on the street.\n\nOther websites also commented on the news.
