I never really know if I am doing well or not. The information on the status page is wrong when it says that the IPB server is at 1% capacity and that there are 2 members.\n\nAlso, when you have a warning that says "98% of our members are having issues at the moment" when there are 3 members and only one of them is having problems.\n\nI have reported all of this to support and I have received no response.
