Lunch at Boogaloo, it's the word on the street. If you are seeking something special with an exceptional view, then this is the place to go.\n\nItâ€™s located in the heights, with an amazing view of downtown and the James River. They have a great happy hour with free bites to nibble on while you wait for your table. They have the bar seating with a great view of the view and if you're lucky enough to have a larger party they have a great upper deck with a view of downtown and the James.\n\nI had the calamari and fried green tomatoes which were both delicious. Our meal was delicious and fresh and the service was impeccable. Definitely a must if you are seeking a nice place to eat in Richmond.
