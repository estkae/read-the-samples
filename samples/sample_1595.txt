"According to the latest data from market researcher GfK, Microsoft’s Xbox 360 is the most popular console in France, ahead of Sony’s PlayStation 3 and Nintendo’s Wii.\n\nDuring the 12 weeks ending on January 5th, Xbox 360 sales were 5.3 percent of the total market, compared to the PS3 at 4.7 percent and Wii at 4.3 percent.\n\n"The latest 12 weeks have been a good one for Microsoft, with Xbox 360 selling more units than PlayStation 3 and Wii combined,” said Philippe Carle, GfK Entertainment’s managing director for France, Spain and Andorra. “In the same period, Wii and Xbox 360 outperformed PlayStation 3 and Nintendo sold less Wii units.”\n\nThe stats were first revealed by Microsoft in the country, but according to MCV the figures don’t account for digital sales.\n\nBack in December, Sony announced that it had sold more than 70 million PlayStation 3 consoles worldwide.
