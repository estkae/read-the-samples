Himawari-8 is a Japanese geostationary weather satellite developed by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). It is the second in the Himawari series of satellites, following Himawari-7 which launched in October 2013.\n\nLaunch and orbital configuration [ edit ]\n\nHimawari-8 was launched by Arianespace using an Ariane 5ES carrier rocket flying from ELA-3 at the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana. The launch occurred at 22:09 UTC on 2 October 2014, and marked Arianespace's sixth launch of the year and the second Ariane 5ES launch of the year.[3] It was the 70th Ariane 5 launch overall.\n\nThe satellite was built by Mitsubishi Electric, and is based on the DS-2000 satellite bus. It is equipped with two solar arrays, with a span of 33.9 metres (111 ft). It is expected to operate for ten years, although the JMA is required to maintain it for only five. It is expected to weigh approximately 2,800 kilograms (6,200 lb) at launch. The spacecraft was originally intended to be named Himawari 8, but was renamed before launch.\n\nIt was the third satellite to be launched for the second generation Himawari observation system. Himawari 8 and 9, along with the Himawari-7 satellite, will produce a continuous image of the Earth. A main difference from the first generation Himawari system is that the new satellites can scan the visible hemisphere with a 15-minute interval, allowing for more frequent observations and allowing meteorological phenomena to be analysed with greater speed and accuracy. Himawari-8 is positioned above the geostationary orbit at a longitude of 140Â° East.
