Baylor Athletic Director Ian McCaw has resigned his position at Baylor University effective immediately, the school announced Wednesday afternoon.\n\nHe’ll be reassigned to another position within the university, but the details of his new position are not yet known.\n\nA Baylor spokesperson confirmed McCaw's departure to our KWTX news partners, but could not elaborate on why he resigned.\n\nIn the statement announcing McCaw’s resignation, Baylor said:\n\n"Baylor University announced today that Ian McCaw has tendered, and the University has accepted, his resignation as athletics director. McCaw is currently serving a 60 day suspension at the direction of the Board of Regents.\n\nBaylor’s statement also said:\n\n"In addition, McCaw will be placed in an “advisory role” within the University for a period of time to be determined by the Board of Regents, according to the Board Chair."\n\nAthletic director duties will be turned over to interim Athletic Director David Kay, who was named to that position on May 30.\n\nThe board said it was still reviewing the "athletic department’s structure."\n\nBaylor said its board of regents would continue to work to update its sexual assault policy.\n\nA report from the law firm Pepper Hamilton cited concerns about the school’s "athletics culture and the lack of a supportive climate for reporting sexual violence."\n\nThe Board said it planned to be more transparent in the future.\n\n"We must be honest and forthright in our dealings with the issues we face today, and we must never lose sight of our goal of achieving the highest standards of ethical conduct," the Board said.\n\nIn May, the school said it had fired football coach Art Briles.\n\nThat was just one part of the fallout from the Pepper Hamilton investigation, which was ordered after football player Sam Ukwuachu was convicted of rape.\n\nThe school also suspended athletic director Ian McCaw and moved another athletics official off campus.\n\nUkwuachu’s conviction had been the latest in a series of accusations and incidents involving Baylor’s football players and allegations of sexual assault.\n\nMcCaw had served as Baylor’s athletic director since 2003.\n\nBaylor University has placed McCaw on suspension pending an independent review, and has publicly supported his "fight to show his innocence."\n\nThe school said it had been unaware of the accusations made against McCaw when it chose to suspend him.
