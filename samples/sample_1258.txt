During the summer of 2011 I did a lot of traveling. It was a fantastic time of exploring the northeast and getting to know my new home. This was before I had a car.\n\nDuring that summer I did a lot of biking, mostly in the afternoons, and it was a great way to stay cool during the day. I took this picture while I was biking in Huntington, Long Island. The map is on the reverse of the photograph. I wish I could go back there and bike it again.
