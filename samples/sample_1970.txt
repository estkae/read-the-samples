"Superstitions\n\nChauffeur sat in a cabin behind the main lounge, but, thanks to the many long trips he had taken, he knew the route so well that he often needed no directions to tell him where he was.\n\nHe had been many times to Las Vegas, and now the sight of the new hotel rising from the desert was as familiar to him as the interior of the Ticonderoga.\n\nFarther on, he began to sense that something was wrong. He turned and flashed the spotlight over the rear end of the train. He saw nothing.\n\nHe got up and walked to the lounge window, pulled aside the curtains and peered into the night. The roadbed was all right. The cars looked okay. He could see the red tail light of the caboose, just where it should be.\n\nHe glanced at the gas gauge. It was low, but not dangerously so. The big diesel was pounding along at the rate of forty miles an hour, the usual speed.\n\n“No trouble,” he murmured. “Nothing wrong.”\n\nHe dropped the curtain, returned to the control seat and concentrated on his driving. His speed went up to forty-five, and still he felt no loss of power. But gradually he became aware of a loud, unusual noise.\n\n“Like the high-pitched screaming of a police whistle,” he said later. “Like nothing I ever heard before.”\n\nHis speed dropped back to forty. The train suddenly seemed to have lost all its power. The whistlelike noise grew louder and louder, and seemed to be just behind the coach.\n\n“What the hell is it?” Chauffeur muttered.\n\nHis hands gripped the wheel and his eyes stared at the track ahead of him. He could see the spot of red light from the caboose.\n\nAnd now a strange, sweet odor, a sickening, penetrating, sickly sweet odor, began to fill the air in the cab. The diesel was still running, but the wheels on the right side of the coach suddenly began to slip on the rails.\n\nChauffeur stood up and held the wheel with both hands, trying to keep the coach on the tracks. But now, with a thunderous crashing and grinding, the big steel wheels began to turn wildly, off the rails, then back on again.\n\nFor a few moments the coach swayed violently from side to side. Chauffeur could do nothing but cling to the wheel. The engine, still roaring and chugging, dragged the coach off the track, then back again.\n\nAt the end of each swaying, Chauffeur got a quick glimpse of the caboose. He saw the red light jerk in a crazy pattern, side to side, front to back.\n\nAnd now the whistlelike noise was louder than ever, a deafening screaming that seemed to drive him back against the wheel.\n\nThe left side of the coach went down, then the right, and suddenly the wheels were off the rails and the whole train was plunging, off the tracks, down an embankment.
