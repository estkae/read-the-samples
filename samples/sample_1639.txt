There was another “fantastic” sale at the world’s largest online vendor, Amazon.com, but it was not as good as the Black Friday 2014 sale. Most sales were 5-20% off list, and the discounts were similar to the previous “Lightning Deals” on Amazon. While the prices were lower, the products were pretty much the same as the past year.\n\nHowever, if you had a baby, bought it a new car seat, or a crib in the past 6-7 months, then you may have lucked out! While you may be able to get an awesome deal on car seats or a crib, but remember, these items are pretty much useless without a car or a home to put them in.\n\nHowever, there are a few items that are worth buying right now, such as the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ80 4K Ultra HD 16.0 Megapixel Camera, which is $200 off the retail price. If you plan on buying this as a Christmas gift, you can still give the gift, and then have your credit card company return the money. You will have to pay the return shipping costs. I think this camera is a good gift for your kids to start them off right with good pictures.
