Hello, I hope I'm posting this in the right area, I'm not sure. But I am in a bit of a predicament. I got my first laptop (Dell Inspiron 15R) for Christmas, and when I put it on my first university assignment it worked fine, for like 3 days. Then all of a sudden it starts turning off by itself. I've tried it on multiple chargers and outlets, still the same. I then found out that the reason why it would do this was because I had the processor set on High Performance, which I've now changed to Balanced, but that's still not fixed the problem. I have had this laptop for 2 weeks, and it's really beginning to make me feel insecure in a laptop.\n\n\n\nDoes anyone know what this could be, and how to fix it? Thanks.
