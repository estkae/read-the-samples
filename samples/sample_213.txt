"It was not easy for me at all. I'm so used to the typical nursing home or hospital setting, it's hard to break out of that. And that's what I was used to. They're a very good hospital. My father is getting good care. They have good, knowledgeable, friendly staff. I really don't have any complaints. It's a little more expensive than some places, but not too bad. They have an excellent chef. He's excellent. The only complaint I have is that they are slow to come and get him. They don't come out and take him for a shower. We have to go get him. But we know they're busy. It's not like they can just send someone.\
