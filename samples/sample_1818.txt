"Johnny Sexton, Tadhg Furlong, Cian Healy, Rob Kearney and Conor Murray have been passed fit to play in Ireland’s clash with Wales in Dublin on Saturday.\n\nSexton, who suffered a dead leg in training last week, is expected to start at fly-half.\n\nFurlong missed training on Tuesday but made it through a more intensive session on Thursday and Friday. Healy, Kearney and Murray were all involved in the squad’s training session in south Dublin on Thursday afternoon.\n\nRobbie Henshaw, who suffered a shoulder injury in the second half of Ireland’s defeat to England last time out, is out of the rest of the series.\n\nJosh van der Flier is the only other injury concern. The flanker suffered a concussion in the first half of the defeat to England and has been ruled out of the match day 23.\n\nConnacht centre Bundee Aki is set to make his Ireland debut. The New Zealander replaces Henshaw at outside centre.\n\nDave Kearney is at full-back with Rob Kearney coming in at 15. Keith Earls shifts to the left wing.\n\nRobbie Henshaw will miss the rest of the series against Wales.

Cian Healy will start at loosehead. Kilcoyne was drafted into the squad as cover for Jack McGrath who is out for the rest of the series with a knee injury.\n\nMunster’s Niall Scannell was due to start but the tighthead suffered a calf injury in training and had to be replaced by Kilcoyne.\n\nJordi Murphy is set to make his debut for Ireland, having won his first cap off the bench against England.\n\nJames Ryan, Devin Toner and Tadhg Furlong have been selected in the starting XV.\n\n“Devin Toner, James Ryan and Tadhg Furlong, they’ve had a great couple of games for us,” said head coach Schmidt. “They were a big part of the win in Chicago.\n\n“Jordi Murphy comes back in. He played very well for Leinster on Friday night. It’s very exciting for Jordi, he’s been a really good international player over a number of years and he’s played in a number of positions for us, particularly in the back-row, but also we know he can cover a lot of positions in the back-line.\n\n“It’s great for Jordi and it’s great for us because it gives us a lot of flexibility. Obviously Robbie (Henshaw) won’t be available and Bundee (Aki) comes in to the midfield and it’s great for him. He’s had a great season and he’s fitted in very, very well with the group. It’s exciting for Bundee and he’s had a great week and he’s ready to go.”\n\nIreland (v Wales, 2018 RBS 6 Nations Championship, Aviva Stadium, Saturday, 4.45pm):\n\n15.
