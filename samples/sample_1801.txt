"Dwyane Wade apparently went to bed early and slept through the Miami Heat’s loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday.\n\n“I missed it?” he asked. “Why?”\n\nBecause the Heat are playing terrible basketball, he was told.\n\nDigital Access For Only $0.99 For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today.\n\n“Oh, they are,” Wade said. “Well, they had their shots to win the game. We didn’t come out and make shots. We had a lot of opportunities to make plays and didn’t make them. It’s like that sometimes.”\n\nThe Heat has lost eight of its last 11 games and eight in a row at home, where it will be for four of its next five games. This is the first time Miami has lost eight in a row at home since the 2007-08 season, the last time Wade played with Shaquille O’Neal.\n\nSHARE COPY LINK Dwyane Wade scored 18 points in the Miami Heat's 103-91 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. March 18, 2016. Video by Manny Navarro\n\n“It’s never a concern,” Wade said of losing eight in a row at home. “I mean, if it goes on and on, then it becomes a concern. But for us, we’re at a point right now where we have to figure some things out.”\n\nAfter a furious start, Miami trailed by as many as 19 points and lost to the NBA’s second worst team by two. The Heat is now a game under .500 (23-24) and barely holding onto the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.\n\nIt is the first time Miami has been a game under .500 since March 11, 2009.\n\nMiami shot 38.2 percent from the field and was 6 of 20 on threes. The Heat scored 17 points in the first quarter and finished with 91, the fewest since the 1993-94 season.\n\n“It was a poor performance by us,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “You have to compete in this league.”\n\nHere are our five takeaways from the Heat’s loss:\n\nNo adjustment\n\nIt is amazing that the Heat hasn’t figured out that Hassan Whiteside has to play in the second half if the team wants to win. Whiteside has to play in the second half, even when he’s not scoring or having a big impact, to at least give Miami a chance. Whiteside has been so bad offensively the last two games, you’d think Spoelstra would adjust his second-half rotation to at least put Whiteside on the court for the entire fourth quarter. But he didn’t. The Heat played one of its worst offensive halves of the season in the second half Friday and Whiteside watched the game from the bench, where he sat for the last seven minutes. Whiteside has played the fourth quarter in each of the last three games and in the loss to the Memphis Grizzlies he scored three points on 1-of-6 shooting and grabbed one rebound. The Grizzlies outscored the Heat by 13 in the second half and Wade was the only player who made an impact offensively in the fourth. He scored 12 points on 5-of-8 shooting.\n\nBackup big man\n\nMichael Beasley had one of the best games of his career Friday, scoring 23 points on 9-of-13 shooting and grabbing five rebounds. Beasley is one of Miami’s better shooters, but he’s only averaging 6.5 points per game. He hasn’t been a significant contributor this season.\n\n▪ What’s going on with Beasley?\n\n▪ What does Michael Beasley have to do to earn more minutes?\n\nCan’t hit a shot\n\nThe Heat’s field goal percentage has dropped each of the last four games, from 51.9 percent to 47.2 percent. In this eight-game losing streak, Miami is shooting 43.8 percent from the field and 29.4 percent from three.\n\n“It’s tough,” Goran Dragic said. “We didn’t make a lot of shots. It’s not like we can blame the game on that. We played good defense. We were trying to come back in the game. We just didn’t have a lot of open shots.”\n\nMaintaining possessions\n\nMiami has one of the worst offensive ratings in the league. It is only 24th in the NBA in fast-break points per game. Miami got very little out of its guards in transition Friday, scoring just six points in transition. Goran Dragic led the Heat with two fast-break points.\n\nThe Heat is in a bit of a transition period with Dwyane Wade leaving. It is in a search of a new identity. But if it can get good, efficient production out of its young guards, it could get off to a good start. But that didn’t happen Friday.\n\nYou have to make shots\n\nEven if the Heat isn’t making shots, it needs to shoot the ball better. The Heat was just 6 of 20 on threes and its shooting percentage dropped below 30 percent. If Miami is going to have any chance at getting a shot to make the playoffs, it has to find a way to improve its field goal percentage.
