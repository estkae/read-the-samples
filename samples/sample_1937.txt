A petition to stop a wind farm near to a motorway has received more than 1,000 signatures.\n\nThe move follows a decision by the Scottish Government that the development at the Carrongrange wind farm would be granted planning permission.\n\nThis has prompted the petition, started by resident Julia Young, which says the proposed site is too close to the M9 motorway.\n\nThe petition says: “The M9 is in regular use by traffic travelling to and from Glasgow, Stirling and Edinburgh.\n\n“The noise from this type of wind farm has been shown to significantly reduce the quality of life of nearby residents.\n\n“The wind farm is near to a school, the River Forth, two residential estates and a visitor attraction.”\n\nSo far more than 1,000 people have signed the petition, and it aims to have more than 2,500 signatures.\n\nIf the petition gets that many signatures, it will be raised in the Scottish Parliament.
