Throughout the past few months, we've had many opportunities to highlight the way in which the decades-long process of media consolidation has allowed cable and telecom companies to pad their profits by nickel-and-diming consumers at every turn. And while the "average" consumer is more likely to complain about price hikes than the intricacies of media consolidation, the impact is nonetheless real: as Comcast, AT&T, Time Warner and countless other regional cable monopolies face less and less competition, the average cost of bundled cable, broadband and phone services has skyrocketed.\n\nBut while the notion of competition bringing down prices is a myth perpetrated by Big Telecom's lobbying organizations, the idea of competition pushing companies to invest in better, more innovative service has been a staple of the telecom sector for over a century. The problem these days is that the companies that provide the Internet service actually making consumers' lives better -- think Google Fiber, Verizon FiOS and municipal broadband projects -- are increasingly a rarity, thanks in large part to this cozy duopoly between the traditional cable and phone giants and the regional duopolies these companies often created.\n\nCase in point: Google Fiber. Once the shining example of what was possible when competitors were allowed to invest in next-generation networks, the service has recently struggled to expand beyond the nation's more affluent cities, a stark contrast to the company's early expansion efforts. And this week, news came out that Google Fiber is likely to soon face a new set of obstacles that could ultimately threaten the service's survival.\n\nThe news began to trickle out Tuesday morning, when an article in the Kansas City Star noted that Google Fiber is likely to change hands and see dramatic shifts in management. Just a few hours later, The Information reported that Google Fiber will soon be led by a former Qualcomm executive named Dennis Kish. The move will effectively kick CEO Craig Barratt (a former Qualcomm exec) upstairs into a new job focused on "contributing to corporate initiatives." The changes are the latest in a series of struggles for the company's expansion efforts.\n\nWhile the move hasn't been formally announced, the Star's report paints a grim picture of the company's future. One anonymous source told the paper that "the issue was whether or not it [Google Fiber] would ever get built" and that "a lot of the plan was based on using existing infrastructure that had already been built, and that's the part that has hit some snags."\n\nThose "snags" include Google Fiber's use of public, taxpayer-funded rights of way, which, as the Star notes, are often owned by politically influential private companies that enjoy strong relationships with existing ISPs. One local example cited in the article involves the wealthy owner of a baseball team and a very unpopular local ISP (whose executives appear to be no fans of the site).\n\n"Charter has made it clear that they’re not happy with Google Fiber in the city," one local source familiar with the company told the Star. "They’re an incumbent provider and they don’t like the idea that the city is helping Google come in and potentially take customers away from them."\n\nAnd while that's merely a local anecdote, Google Fiber has had to contend with very similar situations in cities like Nashville, where a slow rollout in the face of numerous political roadblocks has resulted in calls for a more open and competitive market in the city. In short, local political forces have been effectively weaponized by incumbent ISPs in the hopes of stymieing the company's efforts to deploy faster, more affordable service.\n\nAnd unfortunately, Google Fiber has also run into problems when it comes to gaining access to existing infrastructure like utility poles, another problem the company faced during its Austin launch.\n\n"In other cities, Google had relied on existing infrastructure to connect customers to its ultra-fast Internet service," the Star notes. "But the existing poles and other infrastructure here [in Kansas City] were controlled by other telecom providers and cable companies, who refused to"
