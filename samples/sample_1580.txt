The attorney for a man who was videotaped kicking and throwing a 5-year-old boy inside a North Carolina Waffle House says his client is innocent of the charges against him.\n\n“He’s a good man. He’s an honest man,” attorney Charles Ervin said of Ronald Exantus.\n\nErvin said his client’s actions on the video were self-defense, but he has seen the video and feels “extremely bad.”\n\nThe video shows two men punching and kicking the boy after his mother allegedly refused to give one of them a cigarette.\n\nThe 5-year-old boy was treated at a hospital after the April 21 incident.\n\nExantus, who was a cook at the restaurant, was charged with simple assault.\n\nTwo others — Joseph and Lavern Taylor — were charged with assaulting the child and were banned from the restaurant.\n\nWatch this video report posted online by WSOC-TV:
