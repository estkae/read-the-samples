(Adapted from the 2014 Urban Tree Canopy Conference)\n\nPotholes are problematic for all of us, and for our city’s trees they represent a real danger. Roots can become entangled in the small cracks between the asphalt and the cement to create the impression that the tree is growing out of the road! And when the roots do become entwined, the pressure can be so great that the roots are destroyed. We all know the danger this creates for the trees.\n\nThe solution to this problem is obvious: pave over the whole road surface. Not so fast! In the City of Chicago, for example, there is a practice that preserves the utility of the tree’s roots and of the road surface itself. The practice is called “milling”. Milling involves cutting the asphalt out in a shape that will not disturb the roots and adding back in a new surface. While the tree is protected, the roots are not disturbed and the road surface is left intact. When a tree is scheduled for removal, this is often the method of choice. Milling also involves improving the root zone around the tree. The roots of many trees can’t penetrate the compacted soil that is found beneath pavement, so it is necessary to mill the area to promote root growth.\n\nMilling is less expensive than paving over a road surface and can also be less expensive than removal of a tree. Milling should be done whenever possible and certainly before a tree is scheduled for removal. There is no need to sacrifice a mature, healthy tree.\n\nAdvertisements
