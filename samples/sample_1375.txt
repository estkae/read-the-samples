“I have made this recipe several times. The only difference is the addition of brown sugar to the dry ingredients (2T) to enhance the flavors and the addition of some pumpkin to the white sugar (1/2c) for a lighter, more sweet tasting doughnut. Just be sure to use cake flour, which is soft and more delicate. You can make these with no fat and very little sugar. They will still be wonderful. I love to make these for my family and friends at Christmas. I hope you enjoy them as well.”
