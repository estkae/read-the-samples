"“Despite the apparent difficulty and diversity of the problems facing our national church, the outcome of our recent Lambeth Conference has to be seen as a positive one.\n\n“Many new members of the Communion’s episcopate have been recruited from the developing world. The church in Africa, in particular, is proving an attractive mission field for some Anglicans from Britain and the US.\n\n“Moreover, the conference gave important support to our already announced policy of sanctioning certain developments in same-sex relationships. While still condemning homosexual practice as sinful, we showed compassion for those whose orientation towards same-sex relationships is unchangeable.\n\n“We were determined that, where there are those in the church who wish to bless such relationships, they should be able to do so.\n\n“The Anglican Church is a church of variety, but it is a powerful testimony to God’s working. The God we serve is greater than our human divisions.”\n\nThe Bishop of London is the sole Church of England bishop to attend every meeting of the Lambeth Conference, one of the two Communion gatherings that occur every ten years. In 1999 the bishop was appointed as the convenor of the Lambeth Conference by the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nBishop Chartres has been the Anglican Bishop of London since 1997. Prior to that he was the Bishop of Stepney and then the Bishop of Monmouth. He was ordained in 1973 and served his first curacy at St Andrew’s Notting Hill.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1982 he was the curate of St Saviour’s West Kensington and from 1982 to 1987, the vicar of St Michael’s Margate. From 1987 to 1993 he was the diocesan missioner for Stepney, and from 1993 to 1997 he was the dean of St Paul’s Cathedral.\n\nBishop Chartres also writes a weekly column for the Church Times, and he is a trustee of the National Council for Social Service. He is married to Penny and has a son and daughter.\n\nENDS\n\nNotes to editors:\n\nContact 020 7886 1291\n\nRt Revd Richard Chartres, Bishop of London\n\nThe Anglican Communion, or the Anglican Church, is a global communion of autonomous self-governing churches in the Anglican tradition.
