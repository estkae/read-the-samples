This is a tutorial on using the Wiimote to control playback in VLC media player, a media player similar to xbmc and Mplayer. This is useful for anyone using their computer as a home media center. I’ll give a very brief overview of VLC as I assume you are familiar with it. You can download the latest version of VLC for Windows here.\n\nDownload the remote control extension here.\n\nStep 1: Unzip the file and copy the WIRemote.dll file to VLC’s plugins folder. If you are using VLC 1.0.6, the default folder for plugins is C:\\Program Files\\VideoLAN\\VLC\\plugins. If you’re using a different version of VLC, check here.\n\nStep 2: Configure the Wiimote. Find the extension’s config file in your VLC directory and open it with notepad.\n\nStep 3: Set up the controller to work as a remote control by adding lines to the config file. Add the following to the bottom of the config file:\n\nAs you can see in the config file, the Wiimote is set up as a keyboard. Each button on the Wiimote can be configured to perform certain keyboard commands.\n\nStep 4: Run the VLC media player and click on Tools > Control Extensions. Under the Wiimote tab, select the channel from which you wish to control playback. Make sure that in the Remote Control section, you have set the Mode to Wiimote and have checked Enable. Click on OK and close the Control Extensions window.\n\nStep 5: Load the movie you wish to watch. Press the Wiimote’s A button and hold it down until the movie starts playing. The buttons on the Wiimote will become active. The up, down, left and right keys on the Wiimote correspond to the left, right, up and down arrow keys on the keyboard. The 1 key will bring up the video player and you can use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through your movies and the enter key to select one. To play or pause, simply press the B button. The Select button acts as the enter key. Pressing Select while on the video player screen will take you to the movie’s directory. Press the Wiimote’s Home button to go back to the movie’s directory.\n\nYou can assign other keyboard keys to the other buttons on the Wiimote. I assigned the A button to playback pause and the B button to stop playback. To do this, in the Remote Control section of the VLC media player’s control extensions, click on the Misc tab. You can assign commands under the Buttons section.\n\nIf you are using VLC 1.0.6, you may need to check the Video Output plug-in option under the Misc"
