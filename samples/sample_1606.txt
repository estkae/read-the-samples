An ethics complaint filed against New York state Sen. Michael Venditto alleges that he used state resources and state time to help his father, Oyster Bay Town Supervisor John Venditto, when he was running for mayor of Oyster Bay.\n\nThe ethics complaint filed by Sean Griffith, a former Republican candidate for town council, says that Michael Venditto would not have won election to his current state Senate seat without the help of his father and that in the time since Michael Venditto was elected, his father has turned to the state senator to help him with Oyster Bay's finances.\n\n"When Venditto was running for state senate, he told voters he would serve his constituents," Griffith said. "It's apparent that's not the case. He's being a yes man for his father and is using his father's position to get his way."\n\nIn the complaint, Griffith said that Michael Venditto had staff members in his Senate office work on his father's campaign for mayor.\n\n"When John Venditto lost the election, he took Michael Venditto into the town of Oyster Bay and Michael Venditto's employees into the town of Oyster Bay," he said. "There are nine people who work for the town who worked on Michael Venditto's senate campaign."\n\nAccording to the complaint, the town has since paid Michael Venditto's campaign bills and reimbursed his campaign expenses.\n\nThe allegations included in the complaint were denied by Venditto.\n\n"I'm not taking anything away from my father. I've got a great relationship with my father," he said. "We haven't done anything wrong, nor have we done anything illegal. Everything was above board and all within the law."\n\nVenditto said he has done nothing illegal and has not broken any laws.\n\n"The idea that I would use taxpayer dollars to fund my father's campaign is ludicrous," he said. "I know what the rules are and I know that we haven't done anything wrong."\n\nVenditto said he's never talked to his father about taking his employees in the town to the state Senate.\n\n"We didn't have a conversation where he asked me to hire his people," Venditto said. "My dad didn't tell me that he wanted my people in the town of Oyster Bay."\n\nThe complaint includes an email exchange between Michael Venditto and Brian Scully, a member of the state senate's policy staff. The emails in the complaint include conversations between the two about Venditto's father's finances and how Michael Venditto was having issues with state budgeting for his office.\n\nIn one email, Michael Venditto said he was going to use a special assistant to the state Senate to help his father.\n\n"I can put him to work on constituent casework, but the same person can help my father with his stuff," he wrote.\n\nThe complaint alleges that Venditto was trying to use state employees to help his father's mayoral campaign.\n\n"My father had no idea that I was going to do that," Venditto said. "I did it because I was getting so much pressure from my constituents who wanted to be helped with housing and crime."\n\nThe ethics complaint was filed with the Joint Commission on Public Ethics on May 31. It is awaiting a response from JCOPE.\n\nThe Joint Commission on Public Ethics is an independent state ethics and lobbying agency that was established in 2011 and given oversight of public corruption, bribery, campaign finance and ethics laws.\n\nNassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice, who is also running for state attorney general, said Venditto's alleged conduct raises questions about whether he is following the state's code of ethics.\n\n"There are a number of issues that raise concerns and if they were to be pursued would certainly call into question whether Senator Venditto is following the state code of ethics," Rice said.\n"
