"All the new games for the week\n\nOnce upon a time, the first week of the month meant a new Switch eShop release was imminent, but recently, Nintendo has shown an admirable level of restraint. The first week of this month is no different, as there's just a couple of new games on the way to the system's digital store.\n\nComing to North America this week is the sequel to the surprise hit of 2017, Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap. The platformer has a rich history on the PC and consoles, but this remake proved to be well worth the time spent by the fans. With a new look and modern gameplay, this is certainly worth your time if you haven't played it yet. The Dragon's Trap releases in North America on February 9.\n\nFor our European readers, this week brings us into the dangerous world of SteamWorld Dig 2. While the first game was critically acclaimed and earned quite a bit of love, this sequel looks to improve on the formula by adding a lot more variety and some online multiplayer options. Dig 2 is a bit more than a week away, and will be available on February 9.\n\nIf that's not enough for you, then you'll be happy to know that the Nintendo Switch's Virtual Console service has something new in store for you. For the week of February 13, the Nintendo 64 classic Donkey Kong 64 will be available on the system's store.\n\nAs always, we'll keep an eye on the eShop and update you on new releases if and when they become available. If you're holding out for some new physical releases, we should have some news later today.\n\nThis article may contain links to online retail stores.
