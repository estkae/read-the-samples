Good for price\n\nBy Anonymous\n\n06 Apr 2012\n\nShimano PD-T400 SPD Pedals\n\n3 / 5\n\nI recommend this product\n\nCons rubber grip strip wears quickly, not made to wear a cleat off road or in the mud Pros inexpensive, comfortable, easy to adjust, replaceable\n\nMy first set lasted me 4 years on the commuter bike and MTB with up to 50 mile/week rides. The rubber grips are made to wear down quickly, and don't offer a lot of friction to hold on to (that's good and bad), but replaceable. The cleat is replaceable too, which is nice if you walk on the pedals a lot (they do have walkable cleats).\n\n\n\nOverall, a great value pedal for commuter bikes. The tension is adjustable, but it is easy to over-tighten and bend the pedal.
