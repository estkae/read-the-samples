Some of these undead are highly intelligent, acting as soldiers in armies or guardians of tombs. More powerful undead have been known to roam the world under their own volition, seeking to kill the living for revenge or to fuel their undeath.\n\nBeing intelligent creatures, undead can be found in many different social standings. In the cities of civilized races, the dead are commonly entombed and given proper funerals, while necromancers sometimes command vast armies of the undead to do their bidding.\n\nAnimate Dead [ edit ]\n\nThe magic-user is able to make the corpse of a creature move and attack.\n\nThe undead created will depend on the level of the magic-user:\n\nIf the magic-user is 1st level, then the undead can be a corpse of a man-sized animal such as a wolf, bear, or lion. The corpse may be "animated" with the appropriate skills such as: Climb, Hide, or Move Silently. The DM will determine what skills the corpse has.\n\nIf the magic-user is 2nd level, then the undead can be a man-sized corpse with two or more of the above skills. For every level beyond 2nd level, the corpse may gain another skill.\n\nAnimated dead may be commanded by the controlling magic-user as a free action, or they may be allowed to wander without purpose as mindless automatons. The undead may also be set to attack one target only or be left free to attack any target within range. The undead may be controlled in such a way as to be under the command of any creature holding the control device, as a charge-based device or wand, as a magical amulet, or by any other means.\n\nIf the magic-user is killed, then the control device is automatically destroyed. If the magic-user is unwilling to control the undead, or if he wishes to relinquish control, then the undead must make a Will save against the magic-user's level +2 or become uncontrolled.\n\nThe animate dead spell cannot create any undead creature with a 4+1 or better on the Hit Dice. If the corpse is missing a limb or appendage, the corpse may not use that particular appendage. The missing limb may be reattached by a cleric with 8+ experience level. The reattachment requires 1 minute of chanting, a flask of holy water, a light fire, and two torches.\n\n\n\nExample: Thaeron, a 1st level magic-user, animates a dead wolf with the skill climb, but the wolf has no skill of hide. This wolf can move, but is not able to hide from the sight of the living.\n\n\n\nExample: Kairon, a 3rd level magic-user, animates a wolf, giving it the skills of climb, hide, and move silently. Kairon now has a very stealthy animal to use for reconnaissance.\n\n\n\nExample: Emric, a 5th level magic-user, animates a dead lion. Emric now has a formidable beast to add to his retinue.\n\nCAUTION: Undead created through this spell may not be raised or resurrected. Only the spell life can restore the dead to life.\n\nAstral Prison [ edit ]\n\nThe magic-user causes a single creature to be imprisoned within its own body. This spell cannot be dispelled, but may be ended by a successful Dispel Magic spell cast upon the victim.\n\nThe victim of the Astral Prison spell will not be able to take any actions, but will be able to communicate normally with any creature within the same square as the victim. The victim will be able to leave his body for up to 4 turns each day, during which time he can move anywhere within spell range and return to his body at will.\n\nThe victim of the Astral Prison spell is not considered helpless while his body is within the Astral Plane.\n\n\n\nExample: Rab, a 1st level magic-user, controls Grog, a 6th level fighter, who is a real bully and would do well to be imprisoned. Rab casts Astral Prison on Grog. Grog is trapped within his own body and is now helpless. Grog can use up to 4 turns each day in which he may leave his body and attack from afar.\n\nCause Disease [ edit ]\n\nThe magic-user may make a touch attack on a creature within spell range, and the victim must make a Fortitude save vs. the magic-user's level or be afflicted by a random disease.\n\nThe spell-caster may attempt to use the cause disease spell a number of times per day equal to his magic-user level. The save DC against the disease is 10 + magic-user level.\n\nThe caster must be"
