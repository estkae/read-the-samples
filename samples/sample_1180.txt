A mysterious and ancient organization that runs the world from behind the scenes. They have been planning for centuries and always know what’s going on, but rarely interfere.\n\nSecrecy\n\nThe Dark Order works behind the scenes, mostly in secret. They know all of the secrets of the world, but rarely get involved with the affairs of mortals. Some members become bored and seek to meddle. Those who cross the line will be “eliminated”, as required by their bylaws.\n\nGoals\n\nThe Dark Order wants to create a perfectly stable society by harnessing the power of free will, but does not interfere in mortal affairs. They believe that if mortals were allowed to make their own choices, society would crumble. The Dark Order does not support dictatorships, but understands that the chaos of freedom would be too much for humanity to bear. The Dark Order only interferes when they perceive that the status quo is changing for the worse.
