Horses, rabbits and fish swimming around in glass globes are an enticing attraction at Hanging Lake Lodge in Fruita. But, for more than a century, the people have had a passion for Hanging Lake.\n\nChildren, horses, deer and pet dogs are all welcome to stay at Hanging Lake.\n\nDogs are welcome at Hanging Lake Lodge, as long as they don't swim.\n\n"There were (people) that were always trying to get to the lake," said Dale Hanks, whose great grandfather built the original Hanging Lake Hotel.\n\nHanks has been running Hanging Lake Lodge since 1972, and says his customers are almost always from out of town.\n\n"They've been told about it by their neighbor, they've been told about it by their son who visited last year, they've been told about it by friends in Colorado, and when they're here they just have to come," Hanks said.\n\nMany visitors are drawn to Hanging Lake by the nearby Red Canyon, as well as the Colorado National Monument. The lake is located in a canyon along the Colorado River, nestled at the base of a rock formation called the Palisades. The National Monument, also known as The Dots, is a rock formation of mostly red and orange that spans for about a mile along the Colorado River.\n\nThe Dots.\n\nHanging Lake is a water body that was formed by lava over millions of years, according to the National Park Service. The water body is fed by a small underground river and water seeps out through the canyon walls to form the lake.\n\nHanging Lake is known as one of the most picturesque lakes in the country, and often the photos seen online or on Instagram have a filter on them. The color of the water is bright blue, the rocks are a fiery red and orange, and the waterfalls are turquoise blue.\n\nA tourist sits by the Hanging Lake waterfall.\n\n"It's an excellent opportunity to do some waterfall photography," said Ben Lin, a Denver resident. "That is what drew me here, the waterfall, and I don't know why, but it is very hard to take a bad picture here."\n\nLin has been to Hanging Lake several times, the first time in 2015. He came with a small group of about 10 people, and the people in his group were in awe at the sight.\n\nThe fall\n\n"This is the best," Lin remembers one person saying. "This is the best picture, we are so lucky."\n\nThe water temperature in the summer is about 45 degrees, and not many people are willing to dive into the water, which Lin says is a shame.\n\n"I feel like you should be able to swim here, it's a beautiful place to swim," Lin said. "The problem is the lake is only as deep as your chin. When you're done swimming there is all that debris and gunk on the lake, you can't see it from up above, but as you're swimming you feel the gunk and rocks in the bottom of the lake."\n\nAlthough swimming is prohibited, people do still swim in the lake, which causes the algae to increase, according to the National Park Service.\n\nHanging Lake is one of the first stops for many travelers, but after leaving the picturesque sight, many people don't realize there is so much more to Fruita than Hanging Lake.\n\nNext time you are passing through the small town of Fruita, consider stopping at Hanging Lake Lodge for lunch, a short hike, or an afternoon in a hammock. The history behind the town and the visitors will not disappoint.\n\nEditor's note: This article has been updated to correct information about Hanging Lake.
