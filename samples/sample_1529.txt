[ad#google-adsense-2]\n\nMitt Romney, in this week’s “Meet the Press,” called upon President Obama to visit with the families of those who lost their lives in the Fort Hood terrorist shooting. President Obama is skipping this grieving duty, choosing instead to avoid any appearance of terrorism by attending a celebrity dinner with Oprah Winfrey.\n\nPresident Obama, a prime-time president, must be towing the standard-issue presidential line on terrorism. Terrorist shootings are the unfortunate acts of a mentally unstable person. Calling a shooting a terrorist attack is a prime act of character assassination, a cheap attempt to advance an agenda. It’s similar to calling a black man a racist. For a president to be so callous to a tragedy is repulsive, but not surprising.\n\nPresident Obama should have gone to Fort Hood.\n\nI hope the families don’t mind me using this tragedy as a teachable moment.\n\nAbout the same time I posted my last entry on my blog (which the Al Jazeera English link points to) in which I expressed my condolences to the families of the Fort Hood tragedy, my mom forwarded me an e-mail she received from my niece in Atlanta.\n\nIt read:\n\nToday in the Atlanta airport I was in the line for TSA security when I overheard two women in line behind me. They were talking about how horrible it was that the soldier who shot all those people in the Army post had been given the death penalty. One said she didn’t see how the President could have “signed off” on it. Then the other lady said it was the president who ordered it! I nearly fell over. As I’m sure you know, they were referring to Nidal Hasan, the Fort Hood shooter.\n\nI’m not kidding. These people honestly think the commander-in-chief signed off on the death penalty for a military officer for killing other military officers in the name of Allah!\n\nAt the time, I was dumbfounded by this. I read this e-mail out loud to my wife, who also could not believe it.\n\n“It’s almost like we live in an alternate universe,” I said. “We can’t even get our facts straight,” she replied.\n\nI was appalled that people actually believe the President signed off on the death penalty. Did these women not know that President Obama, along with most other liberal politicians, is against the death penalty?\n\nIf these two women were so misinformed as to believe the President ordered the death penalty for the Fort Hood shooter, what other misinformed beliefs do they have? Could they believe that President Bush caused the current economic crisis? Could they believe that Obama passed Obamacare? Or that he killed Osama Bin Laden?\n\nIf they believe this then it might be possible that they also believe in evolution, too.\n\nIf they’re ignorant enough to believe in evolution, then how could they not believe in that President Obama is a Muslim, when he was raised by a Muslim stepfather? If these people are that misinformed as to believe that President Obama is a Muslim, then how could they not believe in global warming?\n\nI’m not trying to be funny, I’m trying to highlight how important it is for our mainstream media to report the news in an unbiased manner. We should be informing people what is actually happening, not only what is going on in the liberal’s minds.\n\nThese"
