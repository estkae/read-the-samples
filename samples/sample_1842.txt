\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the Kaleidoscope at Kulture Shop , we are so honored to host six monthly episodes of The Show Called Is This Real Life?? It’s a live variety show that will absolutely blow your mind! The concept of the show is to put real life on the spot. We will have improvisers put their real life on the spot by asking the questions “What is real? What is reality?” They will have to answer truthfully. We will have drag, music, dance, burlesque, comedy, magic, and anything else we can think of in order to find out what’s real. Come join us and support live art and live theater!\n\n\n\nClick on the link below to check out the next episode of The Show Called Is This Real Life??\n\n\n\nThe Show Called Is This Real Life Episode 3
