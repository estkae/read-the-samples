The dopaminergic effects of a catechin-polyphenol (epigallocatechin-3-gallate, EGCG) and its derivatives were investigated in striatal dopamine (DA) levels and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and DA transporter (DAT) mRNA expression. Male ICR mice were given 1.5 g/kg EGCG or its derivatives, including theaflavins, for 3 d. The brains were dissected for DA, DOPAC, and HVA contents and TH and DAT mRNA levels"
