Hi Guys,We need your help.We are writing an essay about a topic of our choice and we need help with a paragraph.The topic is:"The more mobile and connected we are, the more isolated we feel. Is it because the more we interact the more we expect? Is it because our friends are not always available? We are flooded with so many information but we donâ€™t know how to manage it and, in a way, are lost in it. The real question is, how can technology provide more human connections and make us less lonely? "Please feel free to share any ideas you have.Thanks and have a great day.Thesis = + http://www.plenglish.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9288:2014-04-21-22-52-20&catid=40:tecnologia-ciencia&Itemid=51
