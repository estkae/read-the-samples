"The US Forest Service has announced that the Fern Lake Fire is fully contained and the evacuation advisory for North of Tofte has been lifted. This comes after firefighters spent the last week building up the fire lines around the blaze. It also means that Minnesota State Highway 61 is now open to traffic again, as are Highway 1 and Highway 61 (Forest Roads 18 and 55), which run through the fire area.\n\nAs of Monday morning, there are still seven aircraft and 380 firefighters assigned to the fire, which was estimated to be 70 percent contained. It has burned 6,900 acres and its cause remains under investigation.\n\nThe next update is expected by Friday morning.
