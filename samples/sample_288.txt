Mick Campbell: Some Hilarious (but Informed) Jokes About Health Reform\n\nHealth-care reform is under way in the US and health-care reform is under way in Britain. Some people may not have noticed the second fact. Over here, the NHS is now the NHS 2.0, or 3.0, or whatever they are on to. We’re getting used to the idea that it will always be changing, and changing in ways we’re not in total control of.\n\nWith my dry British sense of humor, I’ve always enjoyed the NHS. In fact, I like it so much that I even thought of emigrating to a country with an NHS – like, say, the USA. So what a treat to discover in my in-box this morning a compilation of jokes, half of them at the expense of the USA and half at the expense of the UK, about health-care reform.\n\nFrom London, Chris Salisbury compiled them, and here are a couple of samples. The first is about healthcare reform in the USA:\n\n“Have you heard about the new Congressional Health Care plan?”\n\n“Yeah, the government’s going to give you half of what it takes away.”\n\nAnd the second, about the NHS:\n\nA man is at the doctor’s office, and the doctor tells him, “I’ve got some good news and some bad news for you.”\n\nThe man says, “Well, I can’t take the bad news right now, so give me the good news first.”\n\nThe doctor says, “Well, the good news is that you have an 18-inch penis.”\n\nThe man looks stunned for a moment, and then asks, “What’s the bad news?”\n\nThe doctor says, “Your brain’s in your dick.”\n\nThese jokes may be inaccurate, of course. For example, the doctors’ pay packets are pretty great, and some of them can do much better work in the US than in Britain. But one thing I know is for sure: it’s great to see the NHS getting some serious attention in the American media. I bet it makes the doctors happy.
