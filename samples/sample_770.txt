For over two decades (and counting), Pierre-Yves David and Gérard Lebel have been at the forefront of the production of artisanal spirits in France, first with Cognac, then with Armagnac.\n\nHaving first encountered each other in 1993, they soon realized they shared the same goal – creating the finest quality eaux-de-vie from the best possible grapes.\n\nHaving turned their full attention to the production of Armagnac in 2000, they founded the Bodegas Saint-Jean-de-Jérusalem in 2004 and opened their first distillery in 2007.
