“I think it’s a great policy.”\n\nWhen it comes to police brutality, one could be forgiven for thinking there’s nothing good to say. After all, there are far too many examples of police officers going over the line and injuring or even killing someone for a minor, or no, infraction.\n\nStill, there are good police officers, and there are police officers who are very supportive of black people, and the president of the National Association of Black Law Enforcement Officers is the latter.\n\nDuring a panel discussion on police brutality, Terrence Cunningham, president of the National Association of Black Law Enforcement Officers, said it was a “great policy” to disarm a police officer if he or she acts violently towards a civilian.\n\nIn this case, Cunningham was talking about a police officer who assaulted a 15-year-old teenager. The officer slammed the teenager’s head into a locker while searching him.\n\nBut Cunningham said something needs to be done.\n\n“When you talk about policy, it’s really great to have a policy that requires a certain amount of force and then requires a certain amount of reporting,” he said, according to The Washington Post.\n\n“But I think we need to go beyond that. I think we need to say that if an officer uses a certain amount of force and it is unreasonable, then I think that’s an offense that could lead to termination,” Cunningham continued.\n\nHowever, he also said something has to be done on the part of the community as well.\n\n“I think we need to address it from a policy perspective and also from a community perspective,” Cunningham said.\n\n“You have a lot of kids in the community that don’t trust law enforcement,” he said.\n\n“When they don’t trust law enforcement, they’re not going to report crime. When they don’t report crime, they don’t get reported. That’s a problem. We’ve got to work together to make people feel comfortable in reporting crime.”\n\nTelling a police officer he or she should be fired if he or she is violent against a civilian is definitely a very good policy to have. Still, the issue of trust is just as big a problem.\n\nIf black people don’t trust the police, and if police officers think they can treat anyone as they see fit because they’re not afraid of being reported, then we have a real problem.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Constitution.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n
