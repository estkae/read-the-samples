Government Fined $55,000 For Killing Eagle In Conn.\n\nState environmental officials were fined $55,000 Wednesday for accidentally killing an eagle in 2007 when they were using an air gun to cull Canada geese at a state park.\n\nDepartment of Environmental Protection spokesman Dennis Schain said Wednesday that the state was fined $5,000 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the death of the bald eagle. The Service also fined DEP $50,000 for causing the bird’s death without a permit.\n\nThe bird was killed when a single pellet struck the eagle’s beak. The bird was in its nest at High Rocks State Park in Milford at the time of the incident. Schain said it’s unclear what the pellet was fired at, but that the department’s policy is to use the air gun to deter geese from landing in areas around parks, not to shoot them.\n\nIn March, the state paid a $1,500 fine after it was found that state Department of Transportation workers had caused the death of an eagle that struck a roadside rock pile.\n\n(Associated Press)\n\nIn other news:\n\nThieves Steal 4,000 Year Old Flint Axe Head from UK Museum\n\nA UK museum is appealing for help in tracking down a 4,000 year old axe head believed to have been stolen by thieves.\n\nThe rare Neolithic tool, which was taken from the Wiltshire Museum in Devizes, had been loaned by a collector and is of national significance.\n\nThe silver inlayed flint axe head has a hole at the top which would have fitted on to a wooden shaft.
