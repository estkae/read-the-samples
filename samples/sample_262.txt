"Format: Mass Market Paperback\n\nI am a big fan of Julie Garwood. I have read and enjoyed all of her books. Most of her works have been historical romances. She is the queen of the historical romance. In her "Garwoodesque" style, she takes on a contemporary setting, but her attention to detail and superb research remains. If you've read her works in the past, you will find this new one to be in keeping with her other works.\n\n\n\nThe story takes place in modern day Scotland. Lucinda Ashton's family has had it rough for the past two years. Her father has been suffering from an incurable illness, her mother's nerves are beginning to show, and her twin brothers are both leaving for college and working part time jobs to help with the family expenses. But, it is her brother Duncan who she is most worried about. Duncan has always been her hero. The oldest and most handsome of the Ashton boys, she has watched him for years make the right choices and resist temptation. Lucinda wants to be a lawyer. But her parents are barely able to feed and cloth their five children, so Lucinda has had to abandon her dreams of higher education. Lucinda is determined to help her parents and her siblings. She will sell her beautiful pearl necklace so she can pay for her brothers' educations and alleviate some of her parents' financial burden.\n\n\n\nDuncan is thrilled to be going to university in Edinburgh. He is determined to study hard and make something of himself. When he discovers that his sister has sold her necklace, he is furious. But, Lucinda has already made the deal and there is nothing Duncan can do to stop it. Lucinda is devastated by Duncan's reaction to her choice. She is so hurt by his harshness that she stops speaking to him. Duncan is ashamed of his anger, and he is sorry for the pain he has caused his sister. His mother, a loving and kind woman, tells him to go to Lucinda and make things right.
