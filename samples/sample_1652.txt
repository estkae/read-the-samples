YELLOWKNIFE, NT — The earliest mineral exploration on the northern coast of Great Slave Lake appears to have been conducted in 1882 by Canadian Arctic explorer John Rae, who worked with several parties over a period of five years. The expedition, which was sponsored by the Geological Survey of Canada, started out at Coppermine and travelled to the northwest. These and other surveys, including some work conducted in the early 1950s, resulted in a good understanding of the region’s geological and geophysical potential.
