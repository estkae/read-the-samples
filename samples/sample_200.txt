I had been really looking forward to it since I heard about it months ago. I enjoyed it a lot, but the final scene didn't end with the punch I was expecting. The entire movie was a quiet, intense build-up to that one final scene and, as much as I enjoyed the movie, I found myself disappointed at the end.\n\nThe film is good, I highly recommend it, but be ready for an intensely quiet movie. You might even want to bring a set of earplugs to help block out the noise from the rest of the theatre.\n\nSend comments to mike@mikeshea.net or follow @mshea on Twitter.
