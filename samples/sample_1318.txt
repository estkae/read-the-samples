"Google announced plans today to acquire satellite imaging firm Skybox Imaging, for an undisclosed amount. Skybox's 40-member team will continue to work from their headquarters in Mountain View, California, and also in Washington D.C., where they have worked to lobby for the rights to send up its own satellites. Skybox has already launched two of these satellites, the second of which was actually the first to use SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket to deliver it into space.\n\nGoogle wants access to these satellites\n\nSkybox is best known for the stunning, high-definition images it takes of the earth's surface from space. The company has managed to make these images available for free through a platform it calls, simply, "Skybox Imaging." This platform hosts images that span the entire earth's surface, though the company's satellites are still limited in the amount of territory they can cover. But now, by working with Google, Skybox could gain the power to reach a much larger audience.\n\nSkybox's satellites are also equipped with video capabilities, so Google could use the company's tech to improve the search quality of Google Maps. Google has made its investment in Skybox public alongside the release of a video (see above) that shows a demonstration of what the technology can do. The company says that it intends to start using Skybox's imagery in the next few months, starting with Google Maps, and to later incorporate it into its cloud-based Earth mapping product, Google Earth.
