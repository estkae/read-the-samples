This article is from the archive of our partner .\n\nWhat a weekend for the few Jews that live in Port Gibson, Mississippi! Someone vandalized the small town's only synagogue, breaking the windows and leaving a burnt swastika and the words "Jew Boys" scrawled on the building.\n\nNachum Alkolai, a member of Port Gibson's Jewish community who owns the home where the synagogue is located, told The Huffington Post that the house and the church next door were attacked by some people who just "had to be idiots." The building is currently unoccupied, but members of the congregation use it for services. "It's not safe anymore," Alkolai told HuffPost, adding that he wants to sell the property. "I won't rebuild it." The structure's doors and windows were shattered.\n\nPort Gibson Police Chief Gerald McNeill told the Clarion Ledger that the town's only Jewish family — the Rosenthal's — was "upset and offended." McNeill said there were no surveillance cameras in the area, so they have no leads in the case, but they hope that the message scrawled on the house will help identify the perpetrators. Port Gibson has a population of roughly 1,000 people, and McNeill believes that the vandalism was the work of outsiders. "I doubt it was someone who lives in the town," he told the Ledger. "Because if it was, they would have been caught."\n\nBut they haven't been caught yet, so for now Port Gibson's Jewish community has to live with the idea that there are people out there who think they "Jew Boys." How upsetting!
