"[In many cases, this book is available for "slightly used" prices at Amazon and the rest of the internet. I also offer this advice: if you find yourself using this book often, buy the paperback, not the hardback.]\n\n\n\nFor a one volume handbook of natural remedies and herbal medicine, I think this book offers quite a bit. The different herbal sections are separated out by area of the body with the body part followed by the particular ailment, i.e., heart disease is followed by the subhead heart disease and some of the suggestions are alfalfa, astragalus, and hawthorne. It also gives you the Latin name of the herb (or tree, or flower, etc) which is followed by a very detailed description of how the particular herb can be used in a variety of ways. You can also find the name in parentheses to the right. In this way, you can find an herb quickly in this volume that you may have heard of, but don't know exactly what it is used for or how to use it.\n\n\n\nI feel like the author offers some very useful information here, but unfortunately the descriptions are so brief that they can be confusing. It's hard to glean all of the information in the little boxes. I've come to rely on it as a resource when I don't have anything else to go on, but I also realize that it is a one-volume reference book and cannot be expected to cover everything. I like to have other books around for that purpose. This book does give a good foundation in herbal medicine, but I don't like using it as a primary resource in itself.
