Why do I love Saav? It's not because they sent me these for review. These are on the top of my head that I will put on at the first sign of sun when I go out this summer. Yes, they look this good on.\n\nMade from 100% organic cotton, the Organic Star Trunk Brief is the perfect summertime style for your perfect beach body. These will feel like you are not wearing anything. The material is super soft and has a lot of stretch. They will last you a long time and are very well constructed. They come in either blue or black, and are available in Small, Medium and Large. They come in a gift box, so they make a great gift too. You can purchase them from www.saavdesigns.com for $40 a pair.
