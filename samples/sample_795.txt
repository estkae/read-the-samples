Well my friends, the new year has come and the first month is almost over. I don’t know about you but this year is starting off much better than last year, if that is at all possible.\n\nJanuary has been great for me and I can’t wait to see what February has in store for me. It is going to be a month full of projects, filming, new and exciting items for my shop, and a lot of catching up.\n\nLike always, we are going to take a look at what went down in the craft room. I hope you are as excited as I am.
