What I love about travelling is you get a chance to taste local food, pick up a language and meet new people.\n\nTravel is a great way to expand your cultural awareness and try new things.\n\nBe open-minded to the experiences.\n\nYou’ll see a lot more on a tour, than just your average solo tourist.\n\nI love travelling as much as I love food, so naturally I’m going to blog about them both.\n\nI’ve created this blog to share some of my experiences, places, and reviews.\n\nHere you can find my best recommendations for travel destinations and hotels.\n\nI want you to enjoy your holiday as much as I did.\n\nSo, keep an eye out for my next travel blog.
