We put this question to Dr Mike Kirby, senior lecturer in ecology at the University of Sheffield. He says:\n\nWhat you have described is probably just a cloud of vapour from the burnt paper. The sheet could be damp and therefore partially burnt. The candle-like effect is from the heat of the fire creating a hot updraught from the top of the paper.\n\nFire normally causes something to expand. When paper is burnt, for example, the effect is to tear it along the grain and to char the fibres. The paper may have had a chemical on it that causes the reverse to happen - shrinkage.\n\nThe shrinking is quite slow and not noticeable to you but the final result is a very sharp rip across the page. The opposite of this happens when you take a photo of someone - the flash produces heat, and this causes the water molecules in the skin to evaporate, which causes the skin to shrink.\n\nNext question: how do giant squid stay buoyant?\n\nGot a question for our experts?
