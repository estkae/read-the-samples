So I need some help with a much larger project. I'm thinking about a 40 foot sleeper coach for a local Christmas parade and our club's Christmas party. I'm thinking something on the lines of this.Does anyone know of any contacts in Kansas that can help with these?If you're going to be at the Iola Car Show next weekend, stop by and see me. I'll be in booth 20 and my club's booth will be right next door. And I'll be working in both, if anyone wants to talk about some pretty cool train related things.I'm not sure if I'm ready to start cutting out these letters yet, but I will probably be asking for some help with them. I'm thinking I need to work on the main letters first and then do the banners. I'm going to be looking for about 5 letters that say "C O A" and 4 letters that say "S L E P"
