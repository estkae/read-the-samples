Did you think there’s no such thing as free lunch? Wrong!\n\nI was an old punk. I ate cheaply. I ate unhealthily. I went out for food once a week, never paid more than $8 for a plate of rice and 2 pieces of chicken. Other times I ate popcorn and French Fries with my friends while watching movies in the cinema. And as I became an adult, I ate badly and grew fat.\n\nLast year, I decided to change my life. I started to save money, and from that day, I stopped eating cheaply.\n\nHere are some tips I picked up.\n\n1. Choose the cheaper meal of the day\n\nMcDonalds have only 2 types of meals that are cheaper than the rest. These are the McD Snack Meal and McD Value Meals.\n\nThe McD Snack Meal cost RM5.69, which includes a Chicken McSpicy or Filet-O-Fish, 2 Nuggets and a 375ml soft drink. The McD Value Meal costs RM8.19, which includes a Big Mac, a McSpicy or a Filet-O-Fish, 2 Nuggets and a 375ml soft drink.\n\nBoth meals are cheaper than the other meals that you can buy.\n\nThe cheapest meal of the day in McDonalds is the Cheeseburger meal.\n\n2. Eat at ‘The’ Restaurant instead\n\nIn Singapore, McDonalds is known as ‘The’ Restaurant. And you don’t need to ask ‘Where is the nearest McDonalds?’, because in Singapore, ‘The’ Restaurant and McDonalds is the same thing.\n\nIt’s a myth that ‘The’ Restaurant is more expensive than McDonalds. In fact, most of the meals that are available in McDonalds can be found at ‘The’ Restaurant.\n\nThe most expensive meal in ‘The’ Restaurant is the Set Dinner (Veg/Chicken). The meal costs $7.20. The most expensive meal in McDonalds is the Cheeseburger meal, which costs $4.29.\n\nAll other meals in ‘The’ Restaurant are cheaper than the other meals in McDonalds.\n\nFor example, the cheapest meal in ‘The’ Restaurant is the Curry Puff. The Curry Puff costs $3.10. The cheapest meal in McDonalds is the Cheeseburger meal, which costs $4.29.\n\n3. Eat from 7-Eleven instead\n\nThere are two reasons why I suggest you eat at 7-Eleven instead of McDonalds or ‘The’ Restaurant.\n\nThe first reason is, the food at 7-Eleven is almost as good as the food in ‘The’ Restaurant.\n\nThe second reason is, 7-Eleven sell drinks and fast food cheaper than McDonalds and ‘The’ Restaurant.\n\nFor example, I ordered a portion of Mac and Cheese in 7-Eleven. I ordered the Mac and Cheese as a take away, because I do not have any microwave in my office.\n\nThe cost of the Mac and Cheese is $3.30. And I bought a Pineapple Juice, which costs $1.30.\n\nThe total cost of my meal is $4.60. The same meal costs $4.79 in McDonalds.\n\nIt’s true that the Mac and Cheese in 7-Eleven tastes a bit different from the one that I bought in McDonalds.\n\nIt’s also true that the taste is not as good as the one that I can buy in ‘The’ Restaurant.\n\nBut it’s true that the cost is almost the same.\n\n4. Avoid eating at the food court\n\nFood courts are expensive. The price of food sold at the food courts are almost the same as the cost of the same meal in a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo I’ll suggest you avoid eating at the food court.\n\n5. Make food at home\n\nI make sure I cook once a day. I try my best to cook healthy meals. And the cost of the food that I make at home is much cheaper than the cost of a fast food meal.\n\n6. Eat with other people\n\nThe total cost of my meal depends on how many people are eating the same meal.\n\nFor example, I shared a Big Mac meal with my friend. The total cost of the meal was $8.20. That’s because the meal cost $4.29 each.\n\nThe cost of the meal depends on how many people are eating the same meal. The cheaper meal is when I eat alone.\n\n7. Share the meal\n\nSometimes I share the meal with my partner. I usually share a meal with my partner once a week. I share the meal because I feel bad that my partner is eating alone while I’m eating with my friends.\n\nIf I share the meal with my partner, the total cost is $4.60.\n\nIf I eat alone, the total cost is $4.79.\n\n8. Always look for a promotion\n\nIn McDonalds, ‘The’ Restaurant and 7-Eleven, there are always promotions.\n\nFor example, 7-Eleven and ‘The’ Restaurant sometimes offer discount on their drinks and fast food.\n\nSo I suggest you always look for a promotion before buying a meal.
