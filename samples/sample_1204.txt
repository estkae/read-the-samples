In the meantime, we also had to find a TV and a bookcase to fill. On finding these we got three little stickers to put in our homes.\n\nThe aim was to get as many points as possible, by trying to get to our home quickly, and collecting points for doing so.\n\nWe were racing against each other, and the person who collected the most points was the winner.\n\nOverall, I think it was a great experience as it allowed us to practice our sprinting skills and fine-tune our knowledge of the town. It also tested our thinking skills and proved that we can use our map reading skills to locate shops quickly.\n\nAfter this, we all received a tea, coffee or hot chocolate in a mug and were able to eat our lunch. There was even a picnic area where we could eat our sandwiches, crisps or any other food we had brought with us.\n\nWe had a great time at Blackpool, and I canâ€™t wait to go on another day trip next time.\n\nI would like to say a huge thank you to YKES for organising the event and for being so supportive throughout the whole day.
