Rapper says he wants to release songs that are "like f**k Donald Trump"\n\nLil B has said that he wants to release a mixtape titled ‘Black Man’s World’, featuring songs about “unity” and “equality”.\n\nSpeaking to Billboard, the rapper, who released new track ‘AfricAryan’ in January, said he is “getting ready to drop the ‘Black Man’s World’ mixtape”.\n\n“That’s about unity and equality, about togetherness, love,” he said. “I’m working on it right now, and hopefully it will come out in June.”\n\nThe rapper also revealed that the project will contain songs about “stuff like taking over the world, like f**k Donald Trump, like making history”.\n\nLil B’s last mixtape, ‘Black Ken’, was released in 2016. The release was followed by an album of the same name in 2017, which was released without his consent.\n\nBriefly jailed in January for punching a woman in the face, the rapper later blamed the incident on a result of his “mental disorder” and said he planned to stop releasing music altogether.
