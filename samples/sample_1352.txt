Deadlines. That’s what can make them a dream or a nightmare. Just recently I had a client who was suffering from deadlines, and he let it get the better of him. It’s a common issue, but it’s not one that can’t be dealt with.\n\nMy client had committed to me for a set number of hours per week to write a book. He’d been waiting for my email for a few days now, but he hadn’t gotten it.\n\nMy deadline was already gone.\n\nHe’d signed up for one of my courses, and he wanted his next deadline extended.\n\nMy response:\n\n“It is important that you do what you said you’d do. The problem is you said you’d do it and didn’t. If you can’t follow through on what you said you’d do, what makes you think I can follow through on my deadline?”\n\nSee, you can’t blame the person giving the deadlines, because you’re the one who promised. This is something you need to do for yourself. If you promise something, then you’d better deliver.\n\nNo Excuses\n\nDon’t even go there with the “I don’t have enough time” stuff.\n\nHere’s what I said to my client:\n\n“You set the schedule. If you didn’t set the schedule, then we would not have a contract"
