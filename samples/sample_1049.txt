Case for the defence: Key assets in Australia are still owned by the British, the economy has performed far better than most other Western economies, and the Queen has been a good sport. On the debit side, everyone seems to know that most Australians want to get rid of the monarchy.\n\nBritain has been Australia’s biggest trading partner for over a century. The country is now seen as the gateway to the booming region of Asia. While Australia’s coal and gas exports remain big earners, the growth is coming from its burgeoning services and technology sectors.\n\nAustralia is the world’s 12th largest economy and is one of the world’s highest per capita producers of oil and gas. It is a wealthy country, with its citizens enjoying a standard of living well above that of Britain.\n\nIn the past 20 years the federal government’s spending has averaged 29pc of the economy and government debt has averaged 10pc. The state of the Australian economy is not that bad, considering how disastrous the British economy has been since 2007.\n\nIn the past year, a government debt of $29bn was added to a gross debt of $260bn. Australia’s bond yield is 1.5pc, lower than Britain’s.\n\nBut compared to Britain’s £1.8 trillion debt (94pc of GDP), Australia’s is still small. Its economic record is more impressive than the headlines suggest, and is arguably better than the United States, which has the world’s biggest economy.\n\nBetween the financial crisis of 2008 and 2013, Australia’s economy grew 4.2pc per year, the best in the G20. It has continued to grow, by 2.8pc last year.\n\nOn current forecasts, it will expand by 3.5pc this year and 3.3pc next. That compares to 2.5pc in the US, 2.3pc in Germany, 1.9pc in Japan, 1.6pc in Britain, and 1.2pc in France.\n\nBritain is in a mess. The government deficit, or annual overspend, is 5pc of GDP. It means a deficit of £75bn. A fifth of the economy is not generating enough income to meet the costs of the public sector.\n\nBut what does this mean in practice? The deficit is equivalent to about £2,500 per person per year. In the US, the equivalent figure is £5,600 per person. The UK is not the only country running a huge deficit, although it is the worst.\n\nGermany has run a budget deficit of 3pc since 2007, and Japan of 2.8pc. The deficit has worsened in France and Italy, where it has topped 5pc, while Greece has the biggest deficit of all, at 11pc. The high-debt model is not confined to the UK.\n\nIn Australia, the state borrows $3,500 per person. As well as supporting its social safety net, this enables the government to invest in the future and provide essential services. But this means that it has to pay a high price.\n\nIn the past five years, government borrowing has been the equivalent of 12pc of GDP. In Britain, it has been 8pc.\n\nThe public sector has to pay more for its debt, as interest payments now consume 11pc of government spending. But that is still much lower than the UK.\n\nThe main problem for the government is that as a result of the overspend, the budget deficit has blown out to 5pc of GDP. But in the past year, tax revenues have fallen back by 3pc.\n\nThis has been partly due to the high Australian dollar and the fall in commodity prices, which have hit the mining sector.\n\nIt has also reflected the sluggish global economy and the end of the China-fuelled mining boom, which has led to a fall in capital investment.\n\nBut the big drag on growth has been the federal government, whose spending grew by 4.4pc. That is partly due to increased spending on health and education.\n\nThe budget deficit was not a temporary surge but a structural problem, reflecting the fact that too much money is being spent. In Britain, the problem is not so much the size of the deficit as the debt, which keeps growing.\n\nThat is because the British government cannot control spending. Last year it was 48pc of GDP, twice the average for the G20.\n\nThe budget deficit is at an all-time high, and will be 5.4pc this year, or £75bn. The deficit is 4.1pc of GDP, which is more than the 3pc the government said was sustainable.\n\nGrowth has been sluggish, with annual growth of 1.7pc since the end of 2012. It will be slower this year, when the economy is likely to expand by only 1.4pc.\n\nThe austerity measures in the budget have reduced"
