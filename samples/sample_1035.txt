TOMATO PIE! I love it!\n\n(You can find the recipe at the end of this post)\n\nRemember the very first post on this blog I wrote about tomatoes? Here it is, if you want to read it.\n\nWell I still have my CSA.\n\nYep, still love it.\n\nIt is amazing how much I love it.\n\nThere is a website called CSA Today. I love it. I love reading about CSA, I love reading the stories of CSA members, I love the online recipes, and I love the messages from other CSA members.\n\nThis year I actually had to reduce my share size. I was maxing out my 2nd fridge, plus my crisper drawers, and it was getting a bit crazy. So I dropped my share size from the large one, to a medium one. There are lots of factors that went into this decision. I just need to manage my kitchen better.\n\nThere was a local tomato festival on the weekend. I bought 6 different types of tomatoes. One of my favs, the Black Krim.\n\nI had to try a new tomato pie recipe. I think I will do a couple more recipes before I get to the tomato one. But it is on my list of things to do.\n\nTomato Pie\n\nServes 6-8\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n1 recipe (1.5 cups) crust from a 13.5 ounce can PillsburyÂ® Refrigerated Pie Crusts\n\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n\n3 tablespoons tomato paste\n"
