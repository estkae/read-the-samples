NEGOTIATIONS OVER A RUSSIAN EXIT FROM SYRIA HAVE BEGUN. JUST HOW EASY IT IS GOING TO BE TO CLOSE A DEAL, LESS THAN A MONTH BEFORE THE VOTES ARE COUNTED AT THE ELECTION S, IS A BIG QUESTION.\n\nRussia said today that it is negotiating with other international players to end its military intervention in Syria. The statement followed an appeal from the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, for Vladimir Putin to help end the conflict.\n\nThe Kremlin denied that Russia was withdrawing forces, but said that it was “natural” to consider the options as the end of the fight against Islamic State draws closer.\n\nThe Russian president and his US counterpart, Barack Obama, have been unable to agree on a plan to coordinate their military intervention, but Moscow is concerned that this could leave Russia’s warplanes vulnerable to western forces. Russia is looking for a way to make sure that its strategic and military interests are protected in any new plan to end the Syrian conflict.\n\nMany western analysts say that Russia has been searching for a way out of the Syrian conflict for more than a year, as the casualties of the fighting have mounted, but have concluded that they do not have a workable exit strategy.\n\n“This may be a sign that Russia is more serious about bringing an end to the war than it has appeared, but it is too early to be sure,” said Michael Cecire, a research analyst at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.\n\nSyria has been in turmoil since 2011, when anti-government protests escalated into a civil war between rebels and government forces. Russia has been at the forefront of military support for the Assad regime since 2015, when it began launching airstrikes in the country.\n\nRussia had hoped to make the “war on terror” the focal point of a new Russian foreign policy in the Middle East, but Mr Assad has proved to be a much more complex ally than the Kremlin had expected. Russia’s only remaining hope now is to force a political solution that will allow its troops to depart with some dignity.\n\nPresident Putin’s first attempt to broker a peace plan with Turkey in 2016 collapsed when the rebels in Syria, backed by Russia, insisted on Assad’s resignation as part of a political solution.\n\nPutin’s attempt to broker a new plan at the G20 summit in Germany in July was unsuccessful, but analysts say it has given Moscow some confidence that it could play a role in any future agreement.\n\nWestern diplomats say that it is too early to talk about a political solution, with Russia and the regime controlling more than 60% of Syrian territory and the remaining opposition, mostly based in the northwest and the northeast of the country, forced to rely on Turkish support for survival.\n\nThe best that Russia can hope for now is that the rebels will agree to negotiate from a position of weakness, having seen their military forces driven from the south and the west.
