View Full Version : How can I identify potential variables?\n\nMikeJackness Hi all,\n\nI'm trying to learn about and identify some potential (input) variables for a simple device.\n\n\n\nI've looked at the classic approach using the Analyser to get a range of DC voltages (input values) and their corresponding output values but that's not what I'm looking for.\n\n\n\nI want to find out what variables may affect the final values I am looking for and why they have an effect on the outputs.\n\n\n\nAn example would be, lets say I am looking for DC values of between 2V and 4V. The device I am testing has a button which, when pressed, will alter the value of something between 1% and 100%. How can I find out what that value is? I know that it's 1% - 100%, but I want to know the value of the device and how it affects the outcome.\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nMike\n\nIan Smith You need to identify what it is you are actually measuring.\n\n\n\nAre you measuring the current through a certain circuit? If so, you need to measure the voltage drop across it (and also the current through the circuit itself)\n\nAre you measuring the temperature of a thermocouple?\n\nAre you measuring the force produced by a tensile tester?\n\netc etc.\n\n\n\nThe only way to find out is to identify what is actually changing (when the button is pressed) and what is being measured.\n\n\n\nHope that helps.\n\nMikeJackness You need to identify what it is you are actually measuring.\n\n\n\nAre you measuring the current through a certain circuit?

I'm looking at the values in the actual device rather than the sensor values.\n\n\n\nI'm trying to test a stepper motor, and I want to see if the resistance of the motor changes when it turns.\n\n\n\nI guess I'll have to figure out what the resistance is when the motor is not turning and what it is when it is, then identify the variables that affect it.\n\n\n\nAny more ideas would be great.\n\nIan Smith I'm trying to test a stepper motor, and I want to see if the resistance of the motor changes when it turns.\n\n\n\nAh! Well, you've gone and identified the system (stepper motor) and the variables (resistance). Now all you have to do is find out the actual resistance and how it changes when the motor is turned.\n\n\n\nAlso, have you determined whether the motor is powered from an AC mains supply or from a DC battery (or similar)? You need to know this because AC mains supplies may vary the current they provide, depending on the load (which may include the motor), and some DC supplies may have a current limit (which you may need to bypass if it's too low).\n\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\nMikeJackness Hi all,\n\nI've been doing some reading and thinking about how to approach this, and it looks like my answer is to use two multimeters.\n\n\n\nOne to measure the voltage of the stepper motor (when turned) and the other to measure the current flowing through it (when turned).\n\n\n\nThe questions are;\n\n\n\nWhat kind of multimeter should I use?\n\nShould I use a panel mount multimeter for ease of use, or a DMM?\n\nShould I try to build a sensor for the current measurement?\n\nIan Smith Hi all,\n\nI've been doing some reading and thinking about how to approach this, and it looks like my answer is to use two multimeters.\n\n\n\nOne to measure the voltage of the stepper motor (when turned) and the other to measure the current flowing through it (when turned).\n\n\n\nThe questions are;\n\n\n\nWhat kind of multimeter should I use?\n\nShould I use a panel mount multimeter for ease of use, or a DMM?\n\nShould I try to build a sensor for the current measurement?\n\n\n\n1. Both, to begin with. You may only need one, but you may need two, and it's better to have two of them.\n\n\n\n2. As above. If you can't build the current measurement, then either use one of the basic models that has a current setting, or use the voltage reading on the meter and then calculate the current from that. (e.g. multiply by 0.6 to get approximate amperes)\n\n\n\n3. Again, as above. If you can't build a current measurement, then you can get a panel meter to do the job for you, or you can try one of the fancier meters that have current measurement as one of their functions.\n\nMikeJackness Thanks for the replies. I am currently using two multimeters, a panel meter and a handheld meter.\n\n\n\nI've built an adjustable resistance using one of the 5W, 12V heater elements from a microwave. When I put it in series with the motor it showed a resistance of around 400 Ohms.\n\n\n\nI was then trying to identify how much current it drew when it was switched on, and I couldn't get a good result because the panel meter wasn't reading it properly.\n\n\n\nI think that's where I'm at with it at the moment. I may try using my handheld multimeter to see if it can read the current draw, but that may prove difficult because I'm not sure where the current is going through the stepper.\n\n\n\nThanks again for all the advice.\n\nIan Smith Thanks for the replies.
