Wednesday:\n\nBrought two back, used one, but my power supply has burned out on the other one. Had to bring it home today and I will exchange it tomorrow.\n\nUsed two dead batteries on the other camera tonight for a special event. Took many pictures. I will go home and try to fix it before we go out again tonight.\n\n\n\nThursday:\n\nToday is a bad day, my power supply for my new camera has burned out. I had to send my new camera home with my wife. I now have no camera to use for tomorrow. I am hoping that I can have my son pick up a battery for me and return my wife's camera to me tomorrow.\n\n\n\nI am going to return the camera tomorrow and if it isn't under warranty and it doesn't fix my power supply, I am getting a new one. This is not a good way to start off the new camera.
