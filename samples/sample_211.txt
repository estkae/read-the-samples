HapWanderlust September 1, 2011, 8:10 pm it's a very interesting product...\n\nAnonymous September 3, 2011, 12:30 am Thanks for the review, very interesting product and its feature seems to be very promising. However, I wonder what the maximum resolution would be at the time when you take picture and share it instantly, like facebook etc? Would it be just at the same resolution as of the regular picture or even better?\n\nGordon394 September 5, 2011, 12:11 pm This is one of the most intriguing products I've seen for a while. Will the quality be comparable to the smartphone quality, or will it be significantly worse? Are you sure you'll be able to get the same picture quality from the handset as with the phone tethered to a DSLR? I have to say I'm excited.\n\nMatthew September 5, 2011, 8:22 pm Thanks for the review, very interesting product. Do you know how much it will be available to the market and how it will be distributed?\n\nHiFiChris September 7, 2011, 3:56 pm Not sure about this. Love the idea but dont think it's ready. Biggest concern is image quality and would be pretty disappointing to take photos that look awful. I'd be worried about the image quality from the Nikon and would expect that some of the 'features' are just Nikon marketing. Probably best to wait until there are some real world reviews before investing.\n\nR.I.
