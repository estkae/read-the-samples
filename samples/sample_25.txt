"The world of professional wrestling is always changing, but the superstars themselves can sometimes get lost in the shuffle. Sometimes, the changes within the industry are so drastic that a superstar's popularity can get left in the past. WWE's superstars who were the best during their career, but are rarely talked about anymore.\n\nWWE is still the leader of the wrestling world. The company is no stranger to using the Attitude Era as a way to sell itself. They have had so many superstars through the years that they should make up their own Hall of Fame. Some of those superstars are the ones who are mentioned the most.\n\nThe casual fan knows about Hulk Hogan, Stone Cold, and The Rock. That is what makes this so fun. Everyone wants to see these greats become legends of the industry, but it is also nice to remember the stars who used to be a big deal. Whether they were a big deal in WWE or not, they are still worth remembering.\n\nContinue scrolling to keep reading Click the button below to start this article in quick view Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\n\n10 Sin Cara\n\nvia trbimg.com\n\nSin Cara has become a joke of a superstar. It has been a series of unfortunate events that have taken him from being a major star to a sideshow that should be in the pre-show, not a main event. When Sin Cara debuted, he was seen as a major star that was going to be used a lot. It took some time, but it finally happened.\n\nThe problem was that he never delivered.\n\nHe was so unimpressive that he was booted from WWE in 2016. He is making an appearance at WrestleMania 33. For his sake, it would be best if he kept quiet and didn't interact with the crowd.\n\n9 Kelly Kelly\n\nvia tumblr.com\n\nKelly Kelly was a fan favorite during her time in WWE. She made her debut as a popular model who was wrestling on ECW. From there, she rose to the top as a valuable part of the roster. Kelly became a popular figure who had her own dedicated fans. She had the right amount of talent to be a decent worker, but it was her good looks that gave her the extra push.\n\nAfter leaving WWE in 2012, Kelly kept wrestling. She is back on the roster with TNA, but she has not appeared on a television episode of Impact Wrestling since December of 2015.\n\n8 Alberto Del Rio\n\nvia wrestlingrumors.net\n\nIt is a sad truth that Alberto Del Rio has fallen from his former position in the industry. He was a very big part of WWE. He was not only the United States Champion, but also a World Champion. Alberto had a unique presence as a superstar that could do things no one else could do. He also had the microphone skills to back up his moves.\n\nHis tenure in WWE was marred with incidents that made it clear he was not going to be there much longer. His time in Lucha Underground was more memorable, but it was a step down from what he used to be.\n\n7 The Great Khali\n\nvia cagesideseats.com\n\nThe Great Khali is not really a superstar that anyone really misses. His presence was laughable at times. The thing about Khali is that he had a lot of potential. He was very big and very strong, but he never seemed to have any clue about how to use those traits to his advantage.\n\nKhali is now an actor and a former wrestler. He is part of the reality show Khali Kisses, which involves him doing a lot of kisses on people. It is a far cry from his WWE days.\n\n6 Kelly Kelly's Boyfriend\n\nvia youtube.com\n\nWrestlers who are lucky enough to find a wife have a much easier time in the wrestling industry. The same could not be said for Mike Knox. He was only a superstar for a very short time, and he was a part of one of the most bizarre moments in wrestling history when he got the Attitude Adjustment from Kane. Knox is not talked about much these days, but there was a time when people were curious about him.\n\nHe married the popular WWE superstar Kelly Kelly. The couple got married in 2014. It was a marriage that was not meant to last, as the couple divorced in 2016.\n\n5 Santino Marella\n\nvia ringsidenews.com\n\nSantino Marella will forever be a part of WWE. The WWE Hall of Fame is home to some great wrestlers and some very bad wrestlers. Santino is among those who have made an impression for one reason or another. His career with the company was not as successful as he had hoped, but he made a huge impact. He was the guy who was hilarious because he was so bad.\n\nSantino's last match was in 2014. He has done some backstage work, but the star has pretty much disappeared from WWE.\n\n4 Tyson Kidd\n\nvia heavy.com\n\nTyson Kidd was a true performer in WWE. He had a unique look, and he could really do it all. The man was skilled on the mic, in the ring, and he had a good personality. Everything came together for Tyson, but that would all change during an unfortunate injury. Tyson was a mid-carder who could have risen to a top level, but that was not meant to be.\n\nKidd is now recovering from his neck injury. He is still hoping to get into the ring again, but it is looking unlikely.\n\n3 Christian\n\nvia bodybuilding.com\n\nChristian is not a name that is being mentioned much these days. It is a shame, as he is one of the best performers of his time. Christian has made a career of being known for his impressive in-ring work and his ability to entertain fans. Christian was a popular superstar during his time in WWE and he did some good things for TNA.\n\nChristian has not been in the ring since December of 2015. He is trying to get back into the ring, but there is a possibility that his neck injury may have ended his career.\n\n2 Dolph Ziggler\n\nvia wrestlingnewssource.com\n\nDolph Ziggler had the chance to become a very big star in WWE. Unfortunately, things have not been going well for Ziggler. He was once a main eventer, but he has fallen to the bottom of the card. He is one of the many guys who will be pushed as the underdog who is going to have the moment of their life.\n\nZiggler has not been the focus of WWE. It is likely that he will be entering a new chapter of his career in the near future. The most likely place would be in Ring of Honor, but WWE has shown a lot of interest in Ziggler.\n\n1 Wade Barrett\n\nvia wrestlingrumors.net\n\nIt is going to be very hard for the casual fan to remember Wade Barrett. He had a short run in WWE, but he did his part as a mid-carder. Barrett is a former Intercontinental Champion. He did well in WWE as a member of The Nexus, but his star power never quite took off.\n\nBarrett has been out of WWE since 2014. He has had some ups and downs in the independent circuit, but his career has largely gone downhill. It is possible that he could get another chance with WWE. That would probably be the only way that fans would get to see him again.\n\nBarrett has been trying to make a name for himself in the business world. He launched a website last year. It is not likely that he will become a success, but it is nice to see him try to make something of his life.
