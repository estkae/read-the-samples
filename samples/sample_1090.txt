The It Girl for the Common Man — Samuel Adams’s Boston Lager, and of course the brand’s entire line of beer — is nothing if not ubiquitous. These days it can be found at your favorite watering hole, most chain restaurants and some grocery stores. But Samuel Adams’s new brew in the 22-ounce bomber-size bottle, Triple Bock, is a little different.\n\nIntroduced in 1995 as a strong winter brew, the brand brought the brew back with a vengeance in 2006. Now you can find it everywhere, though often in local craft beer outlets for about $10 or $12 a bottle.\n\nWith a whopping 18 percent ABV, Triple Bock is not exactly what you’d call a session beer. That’s fine, though, since its flavor is so well-balanced that it can stand up to even the most robust food.\n\nSo what’s in this beer that makes it so strong? There are, after all, only six ingredients: malted barley, hops, water, yeast, caramel malt and roasted malt. And of course alcohol itself. And yet, it’s the balance of all of these elements that makes it stand out.\n\nThe first time I tasted it was about five years ago, and it was quite nice. This time, however, I was a bit disappointed, though still willing to drink it. It was good — very good, in fact — but somehow I found the beer a bit flat and uninteresting. It wasn’t quite what I was hoping for.\n\nIs it still worth it? Definitely. At a mere $10 to $12 a bottle, it’s a great choice for an after-dinner drink, or maybe as an alternative for a low-alcohol beer (this would be a great choice for an alcohol-sensitive friend at a party). It’s strong, it’s full-bodied, and it’s a nice change of pace.
