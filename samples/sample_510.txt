Top Review by\n\nExcellent! I made this up yesterday for tonight's dinner and I'm really glad I did. This is a wonderful meal and it's so easy to put together. I used boneless, skinless thighs and was glad I did because the meat stayed moist and tender. This will definitely become a favorite in our house. I will have to make a double batch next time though because we couldn't stop eating it!!
