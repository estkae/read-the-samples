"Even though Alabama didn’t have the most dominant recruiting year in the SEC this past year, it still finished ranked inside the top five, according to the 247Sports Composite.\n\nThere is a lot of time left until these recruits go to their respective colleges. Some are solid commitments, others may be headed to other schools or may even wind up in the draft. But for the moment, these rankings will make some people mad and others will praise them.\n\nHere’s how the 247Sports Composite, which averages the ratings from all major recruiting services, ranks the top 10 classes in the SEC.\n\nGeorgia, 3\n\nAlabama, 4\n\nLSU, 5\n\nAuburn, 6\n\nMississippi State, 7\n\nTennessee, 8\n\nSouth Carolina, 9\n\nFlorida, 10\n\nTexas A&M, 11\n\nArkansas, 12\n\nKentucky, 13\n\nMissouri, 14\n\nVanderbilt, 15\n\nOle Miss, 16\n\nAlabama didn’t have the best recruiting year, but it was still pretty damn good. And you could argue that these rankings aren’t that bad.\n\nYes, Alabama didn’t land a five-star recruit, but it did get the top player in the state and the top player at three different positions. Not many schools can claim that.\n\nIs this the year of Alabama? Yes No Submit Vote vote to see results Is this the year of Alabama?

Alabama has three more scholarships to give, and it will probably have a handful of five-star prospects.\n\nIt’s been a good couple of weeks for Alabama. This weekend it lost in embarrassing fashion to Auburn, but the win over LSU put the Tigers in the driver’s seat in the SEC West. The Tide is still playing for a national championship, and its defense has looked good as of late.\n\nIn 2013, Alabama had a good recruiting class, but it was nothing to get worked up over. This year, the Tide had a great class. We’ll see if the talent on the field matches the talent in the recruiting rankings.\n\nAll recruiting rankings via the 247Sports Composite.
