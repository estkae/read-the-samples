A/N: Before I start, I must confess. I lied. In an interview with Josh Radnor from earlier this year, he claimed he would only do a spin-off if it was centered around Ted and Barney, with the two of them going off to some far off place (New Zealand? Australia?) where they lived in a beach house and watched sports. I laughed. A lot. And now that I have come up with a sequel for The Only Person Who Didn't Run from Ted Mosby, I don't really have a plot for it...\n\n(Disclaimer: This is a work of fan fiction. Any resemblance to any other work of fiction is entirely coincidental. Not to mention a little insulting)\n\nI sat on my bed, looking down at my phone. There was only one person who could help me write this...\n\nI knew it was kind of a lame excuse. I mean, my sister works at a museum, for Pete's sake. She can't help me with a stupid paper. What was I thinking? And I had a really good excuse to tell my girlfriend when I get home. We had a date. But, in order to give me that good excuse, I have to write this stupid paper and get it done. I have to talk to my sister.\n\nI dialed the number to my sister's work, and it started ringing. My sister, Gloria, picked up.\n\n"What's up, D?"\n\n"Glor, do you think you can help me with a paper? I really need some help."\n\n"Sure. What is it about?"\n\n"It's a paper about JFK."\n\n"Oh. Cool. Yeah, sure. What do you need?"\n\n"I need some help finding some good sources for this. I need to know how to start a paper."\n\n"I'm glad you asked."\n\nAnd I was off to a good start. I sat at my desk, making notes. The paper was going to be really easy to write. It would probably only take a couple hours. I knew it. And I would be home before Lily.\n\nThe paper was starting to look really good. I had a bibliography in place, a couple of good paragraphs, and a nice introduction. Everything was great.\n\nI had a paper ready to turn in the next morning. It was almost done, and I was free to go home. But I had a date to get to.\n\n"Bartender!" I called. "One more, please!"\n\n"You sure, man? You're not gonna make it home tonight."\n\n"Nah, man. It's all good. I'll just be getting home, like, ten minutes later than I would."\n\n"Okay, man. Whatever you say."\n\nI started walking out the door, but I took the bar stool with me. I had to carry it around to make it look like I was in a drunken stupor. If my girlfriend saw that I was drunk when I got home, I would never be able to keep my secret.\n\nAs I made my way through the train station, I heard a strange beeping sound. I turned my head to the side, trying to find the source of the noise. It was coming from my phone. There was a text message. I opened my phone, and read it.\n\nI was starting to feel a little tipsy. It was a good thing I was carrying a bar stool around. It made me look like I had a reason for not walking right.\n\nThe message was from Lily. I read it.\n\nThe good thing about living in New York was the night life. I was lucky enough to be able to spend an evening at a nightclub, so I would be home in no time.\n\n"Yeah, man," I said. "I don't know why I even did this, dude."\n\nI walked out of the nightclub and back into the train station. I knew it was late, but the train wasn't too crowded. I sat down in a seat, trying to get some sleep. I would be home soon enough.\n\nI woke up as the train pulled into the station. I was close to home now. It was getting a little crowded on the train, but I managed to squeeze myself into the seat. I was a little more aware of the fact that I was still carrying my bar stool, but I decided to go on anyway.\n\nI stumbled out of the train station, still carrying the bar stool. I made my way through the crowd, out into the parking lot, and across the street to my car. I put the bar stool in the trunk, and got in the car. I turned on the engine, and drove off.\n\n"Hey, Lily. Yeah, I'm on my way home. I'm sorry, but I ran into some trouble. It shouldn't take me long to get home."\n\n"You said that you were just going to be a few minutes late. You said you were on your way home, and then you don't show up for three hours. You call me and say you're sorry? That doesn't even make sense!"\n\n"I know, I know. It's just that it took me a little longer to get home than I thought."\n\n"You lied to me! You said you were going to be home at 8:30! I waited until midnight! You were just trying to get out of our date!"\n\n"It wasn't like that, Lily. I had some trouble with a paper, and then I was at a nightclub. I had a lot of stuff on my mind."\n\n"So, you didn't want to come home. You just didn't want to spend time with me. And now you're calling me after it's all over and trying to explain yourself. And I don't want to hear it! Goodbye!"\n\nI was standing at the door to my apartment, keys in my hand, when I heard my phone ring. It was Lily. I stood there for a moment, trying to decide whether or not I should answer. I looked down at the floor, and then back at my phone. I answered.\n\n"Lily, I-"\n\n"I don't want to hear it, Ted. I told you that I don't want to hear it."\n\n"No, no, it's just that I really have to tell you something. I can't wait until tomorrow. I really need to tell you right now."\n\n"Well, fine. What do you need to tell me? Spit it out."\n\n"It's just that...I think that..."\n\n"Ted, you're babbling. What is it?"\n\n"I...I...well..."\n\n"Ted? Ted! You're breaking up. I think the connection is getting worse. What was it?"\n\n"I think we should break up."\n\n"What?"\n\n"I think we should break up."\n\n"What?"\n\n"I...I...you were right."\n\n"What?"\n\n"I didn't want to spend the night with you. I didn't want to be around you anymore. I wanted to get out of the date. I know it's not fair. I know I was a jerk. I know I lied to you. I just...I don't think we should be together anymore."\n\n"What? Why?"\n\n"I don't know. I just don't."\n\n"Ted, I love you. You can't just say that we should break up like this."\n\n"You were right. You shouldn't have to date me."\n\n"Ted..."\n\n"I'm sorry. I really am. I didn't mean to hurt you. You're a wonderful girl. I just...I don't know. I'm sorry."\n\n"Ted..."\n\n"Goodbye, Lily."\n\nI hung up the phone, and dropped it to the floor. I was standing there for a moment, trying to get my emotions in check.\n\nI had done it. I broke up with my girlfriend of three years. I had broken up with the girl I loved. I had no idea why I did it, but I was doing it.\n\nI opened my door, and made my way to my bedroom. I dropped my keys on the dresser, and sat down on my bed. I leaned against the wall, and closed my eyes.\n\n"Hey, Ted. What are you doing home so early?"\n\n"Lily, I..."\n\n"Ted, I know I was mad at you before, but I've calmed down a lot. You know I love you. I can't live without you."\n\n"Lily, I..."\n\n"Ted, you just scared me, is all. I thought I lost you. I thought you didn't want to be with me anymore."\n\n"Lily, I..."\n\n"I know it was wrong for me to keep pushing you to make up your mind about me, but you couldn't see that."\n\n"Lily..."\n\n"And I know that I can be a little difficult to get along with sometimes, but I know you'll come around."\n\n"Lily, I..."\n\n"We're supposed to be together, Ted. We always knew that. You and me, we're meant to be. You can't just do something like this, Ted."\n\n"Lily..."\n\n"I love you, Ted. You can't just throw that away. I can't just throw that away. I can't..."\n\nI opened my eyes, and saw Lily
