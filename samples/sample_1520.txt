President Trump's ban on immigrants from Muslim-majority countries and restrictions on refugee admissions will not get in the way of U.S. efforts to combat terrorism, the Trump administration said in a court filing late Tuesday.\n\nThe filing in a federal court in Hawaii offered the administration's first full-throated defense of the new policy in the wake of a decision by a federal judge in Hawaii who put the order on hold.\n\nThe new policy will allow officials to more rigorously review the backgrounds of those seeking entry from countries where terrorism is rampant, the government said.\n\n"The Order is expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices," the Justice Department said in its brief.\n\nThe Trump administration said that if the new policy were restricted, terrorists seeking entry to the U.S. would "have a greater opportunity to hide in the United States."\n\nThe Justice Department also pushed back on criticism of the new policy from the bench, with one judge in Virginia, Leonie M. Brinkema, describing the president's actions as a "mean-spirited" attempt to keep Muslims out of the country.\n\nJustice Department lawyers said that critics are engaged in "pure speculation" about how the president's policy will be carried out, particularly when it comes to granting waivers to people who wish to enter the U.S. despite the new policy.\n\nCritics also are misrepresenting how refugees are vetted, the government said. "The order expressly contemplates the issuance of waivers to allow people into the country in appropriate circumstances," the Justice Department said.\n\nThe government said the courts should defer to the president on the entry of immigrants from dangerous countries, as well as on the refugee program.\n\n"The president is authorized under the Constitution and laws of the United States to suspend or restrict the entry of aliens outside the United States when he deems it in the nation's interest," the Justice Department said.\n\nThe government's court filing came in response to a lawsuit in Hawaii that accused the Trump administration of discriminating against Muslims and asked for a nationwide temporary restraining order.\n\n"This is not the first time the defendants have asked this court to ignore the impacts of the executive order on individuals," said the brief filed by Neal Katyal, a lawyer for the state of Hawaii. "Nor will it be the last time they try to defend a decision that has harmed so many people."\n\n\nCopyright Â© 2018 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.
