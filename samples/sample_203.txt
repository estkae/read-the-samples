Unbelievably cute.\n\n\n\nThis is a review of the artbook for Lucky Star. I'm not going to write a full review, because you can find that on other sites.\n\n\n\nLucky Star is a 4-panel comedy manga that revolves around the lives of four girls. In this artbook, it also includes background sketches, 3D illustrations of some of the characters, and even some concept art of the outfits.\n\n\n\nThe artwork is cute, and will make you smile, and for me, that's what makes this a good book. It has all the artwork for the series, and all the side-materials as well.
