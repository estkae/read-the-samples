The advisories issued by public health officials on Tuesday confirmed fears of some physicians and food safety advocates who have been sounding the alarm about the perils of romaine lettuce for months.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a new warning Tuesday urging the public to avoid eating romaine lettuce amid a multi-state outbreak of E. coli infections.\n\n"We still have a lot to learn about this outbreak", he said.\n\nEarlier this month, the CDC announced an E. coli outbreak linked to romaine lettuce, including three deaths and 96 sickened individuals.\n\nHealth officials say consumers can not tell if a lettuce is contaminated just by looking at it, but some growers have voluntarily recalled romaine lettuce.\n\n"Illnesses started between November 15 and December 18".\n\nDr. Sarah Corry is with the Illinois Department of Public Health.\n\nHowever, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, said that since it was an active investigation, he could not comment on which states were affected or how much lettuce may have been involved. In the current outbreak, the strain of E. coli identified by the CDC as causing infections in both people and animals is a strain that produces a Shiga toxin known as STX2. In November, 19 people became ill in the USA and Canada.\n\nSo far, the CDC is not identifying a grower, supplier, distributor or brand that is linked to the outbreak.\n\nHealth officials have warned that the cases of E. coli may not be over, and people should still be on the lookout for symptoms.\n\nAlthough authorities have not pinpointed a specific grower, distributor or brand, the CDC has warned that all types of romaine lettuce should be avoided.\n\nOther advice includes properly washing and sanitizing produce to reduce the risk of illness.\n\nThe FDA is working with state and local officials and conducting inspections in the growing regions and in packing facilities to determine the source of contamination.\n\nSymptoms of E. coli can range from mild to severe, and usually appear within two to eight days of consuming the contaminated food.\n\nCases have been reported in Canada and 13 states. The patients have required hospitalization and one patient has died.\n\nPossible E. coli contamination in bagged and chopped romaine lettuce has sickened at least 15 people in NY and New Jersey, according to the CDC.\n\nThat's what can be expected in the aftermath of E. coli outbreaks that have been linked to fresh produce, says Lawrence Goodridge, director of the Washington State Department of Health's Communicable Disease Prevention and Control Program. "I think in some cases, if you don't have irrigation, you have to go through the issue of what's the most you can do".
