Bogdanov Updates: 4474 June 2011 Category: Experimental ISSN: 2070-1721 A Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace for the Open Grid Forum (OGF) Abstract This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace, "urn:ogf:service:GridResource", that was originally allocated for the use of the Open Grid Forum. It updates RFC 4474. Status of This Memo This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for examination, experimental implementation, and evaluation.

Bellis Experimental [Page 1]\n\nRFC 6123 OGF URN Namespace June 2011 RFC4646] to use in the service namespace "urn:ogf:service:GridResource". o The document was initially written as a joint document between IANA and the OGF Secretariat. It was reviewed by the IETF GNSO Council and approved as an IETF IPR policy. o This document obsoletes [RFC4133] and contains an update to [RFC4474] (so a section from [RFC4474] is preserved in Section 10). 2 . URI Scheme RFC4646]. The definition is as follows: scheme name: urn-ogf-service authority: The full DNS name of the service registry (e.g., http:// iana.org). registry name: ogf-service labels: none port: none The registered URI scheme has a binding to the HTTP transport protocol (see Section 10 for discussion of URIs for other transport protocols) and can be used to retrieve information about and provide services to the described resource. 3 . Registration Procedure RFC5226], under the conditions specified below: o Registrations MUST follow the template in Appendix A. The information requested in the template MUST be provided in the registration request. The template is intended to clarify registration procedures only and is not intended to limit registrations, or to be a record of action taken. o Upon receiving the request, IANA will check the request for completeness. o IANA will send a message back to the requester as soon as it receives the request (or, if the request is received by email, within five working days), either requesting additional information or requesting that the request be canceled. IANA will not confirm the receipt of requests by email. Bellis Experimental [Page 2]\n\nRFC 6123 OGF URN Namespace June 2011 4 . Example Service URIs Section 3. Each "http:" prefix in these examples represents the use of the registered "urn-ogf-service" URI scheme. o http://iana.org/GridService o http://iana.org/GridService/ogf-service 5 . Service Namespace Guidelines Bellis Experimental [Page 3]\n\nRFC 6123 OGF URN Namespace June 2011 RFC2606]. When a new value is introduced, it must be registered. RFC4646] has a mechanism for registering special characters in URI scheme names, but it is insufficient for this use, because the permitted characters are restricted to a very small subset of the ASCII character set. If it is necessary to include special characters in URN names, they can be encoded as percent-encoded values in the URN itself. For example, '?' is represented by "%3F". The use of "?" as the last label in a service name is generally discouraged in order to allow implementations to avoid potentially expensive parsing of the URN name. Use of "?" is permitted, however, in cases where it is a legitimate part of a fully qualified resource name. An example is a file system that has the name "dataset?:/my/path/to/a/resource". 6 . Updates to RFC 4474 RFC4474] is updated as follows. IANA has allocated an OGF URN namespace for OGF, in the registry "Grid Namespace and Service Namespaces" (GNSN). The registry is maintained at <http://iana.org/assignments/grid-namespace-service-namespace>. In the registry, a "Grid Resource" namespace is listed. The information regarding this namespace is as follows: o URI Scheme name: urn-ogf-service o Authority: The full DNS name of the service registry (e.g., http://iana.org) o Registry name: ogf-service o Labels: none o Port: none The service URN namespace "urn:ogf:service:GridResource" is maintained by the Open Grid Forum. Bellis Experimental [Page 4]\n\nRFC 6123 OGF URN Namespace June 2011 7 . URN Considerations RFC3986] does not specify any particular character encoding scheme, but URIs MUST use UTF-8 [RFC3629]. This implies that only characters from the ASCII repertoire can be used in URIs. A URI is often (but not always) globally unique and persistent, and it is usually interpreted as a resource name. Therefore, the conventions and best practices for resource naming apply to URNs as well. (See [RFC4395] for general resource naming guidelines.) Specifically, the following applies: o The scheme name and registry name MUST be globally unique. o The labels used in a URN SHOULD be globally unique. 8 . Security Considerations RFC3986]. 9 . IANA Considerations Section 4. o Update the entry in the registry "Grid Namespace and Service Namespaces" (GNSN) by changing the reference to [RFC4133] to refer to this document. o Create a new OGF URN namespace, "urn:ogf:service:GridResource", in the registry "Grid Namespace and Service Namespaces". 10 . Usage Considerations RFC4132] or IEEE 1512 [IEEE1512]. Each of these services has a slightly different approach to accessing the resources that they name. Bellis Experimental [Page 5]
