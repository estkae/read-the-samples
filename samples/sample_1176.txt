Abuja – In order to combat the fast spread of the deadly Ebola virus in West Africa, the United Nations children's agency UNICEF says it will support the establishment of an additional 80 Ebola treatment centres to cope with the rising number of infections.\n\nThe centres, which will be built in the worst affected countries in West Africa – Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone – will provide a more appropriate care for infected children.\n\nA statement by the agency said on Friday that it would also provide for an additional 150 beds for children suffering from the disease, to meet the increased need as the Ebola virus continues to claim more lives.\n\n“We are scaling up our response to the Ebola outbreak with support for community care units, treatment centres, coordination, social mobilisation, psychosocial care, education, logistics, and security,” said Dr Jean-Marie Okwo-Bele, UNICEF regional director for West and Central Africa.\n\n“As the number of children affected by the Ebola virus continues to grow, so does the strain on the limited resources for children and families,” he added.\n\nThe statement further noted that to date, more than 1,700 children have been identified as infected with the virus, out of a total of 4,000 confirmed cases.\n\nMeanwhile, the African Development Bank has stated that efforts to address the spread of the virus in West Africa would remain inadequate without a major influx of resources.\n\nIn a press release on Friday, the bank said the economic costs of the outbreak were significant, in addition to the humanitarian and social consequences.\n\nThe bank, which is coordinating the development of a road map to scale up resources to tackle the virus, has said the total amount required to support the countries affected by Ebola would amount to approximately $1.5bn for 2014, with $570m needed by end-2014.
