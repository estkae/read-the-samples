Not on social media. So I don't know what people think. I know my wife is everything. That's all I need. — Brandon Flowers (@flowerboy) August 5, 2017\n\nOn the last night of a tour, getting some wife-y kisses. And in case anyone was wondering. This is how we roll. pic.twitter.com/zSXlfUgKXd — Brandon Flowers (@flowerboy) August 7, 2017\n\nOh yeah. Still be on tour, still be making music. Not yet a father, but that's coming. Still have some things left to do. https://t.co/CJ1vOs8lYA — Brandon Flowers (@flowerboy) August 7, 2017\n\nYes. It's true. I am getting married. And I'm marrying my best friend. And my favorite person. https://t.co/uOe3DjtMtQ — Brandon Flowers (@flowerboy) August 5, 2017\n\nThe next night, he admitted that he has not yet become a father, but he is working on it.\n\nDidn't say I was a father yet. Wasn't pregnant before. Wasn't even married. But I love my wife and my future kids. pic.twitter.com/uVEXZHScGz — Brandon Flowers (@flowerboy) August 6, 2017\n\nYep. Only day two and already love you so much more than I did yesterday. No, that's not enough. Still not enough. pic.twitter.com/cItd8b8HxY — Brandon Flowers (@flowerboy) August 8, 2017\n\nYou are a goddamn genius. No one can make me laugh like you. — Brandon Flowers (@flowerboy) August 8, 2017\n\nThe next day, Brandon shared the first picture of the newlyweds.\n\nTana and I on our wedding day. pic.twitter.com/6R5xT0P5zT — Brandon Flowers (@flowerboy) August 7, 2017\n\nI can't wait to see you two together at our wedding. — Brandon Flowers (@flowerboy) August 7, 2017\n\nI love my wife and I'm going to spend the rest of my life loving her. https://t.co/2h7LXqHxjC — Brandon Flowers (@flowerboy) August 7, 2017\n\nBrandon gave a shout out to his brother and the rest of the band for not spoiling their special day.\n\nThis is how much I love my wife. I would've wanted to come here tonight. But I didn't. https://t.co/ox7XY3sPGO — Brandon Flowers (@flowerboy) August 8, 2017\n\nJust a normal day. A normal day with my wife. She is my favorite person in the world. We have no plans. pic.twitter.com/vNNkIOCcUQ — Brandon Flowers (@flowerboy) August 8, 2017\n\nCurious to see the rest of their love story?\n\nHappy 5 years to the love of my life, my best friend and my favorite person. I still feel like I'm the luckiest"
