Michal Hašek\n\nMichal Hašek (born April 8, 1980) is a Czech professional ice hockey goaltender who is currently playing with HC Pardubice of the Czech Extraliga. He previously played in the National Hockey League for the Detroit Red Wings, Chicago Blackhawks, Colorado Avalanche, Ottawa Senators, and Florida Panthers.\n\nHašek spent the 1996–97 season with HC Pardubice's junior team, and then joined the Czech Extraliga club HC Vsetín, appearing in 29 games. Hašek was a member of the Czech Republic national under-18 team at the 1997 European Junior Championships, playing in two games and posting a 1.51 GAA.\n\nThe next season, Hašek joined HC Pardubice, which was then playing in the Czech 1. Liga. Hašek played well for the team, and was chosen by the Colorado Avalanche in the sixth round, 162nd overall, in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. He remained with HC Pardubice, and in his final season with the club, he posted a 2.30 GAA in 37 games. Hašek was signed by the Avalanche, and on March 9, 2000, he made his NHL debut, against the Detroit Red Wings. He played two more games for the Avalanche before returning to the Czech Republic to join HC Pardubice for the 2000–01 season.\n\nHašek played in 11 games for the Avalanche the next season, but spent the majority of the 2001–02 season with the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League, where he posted a 2.20 GAA in 44 games. He remained in North America the next season, playing five games for Colorado and 59 for Hershey, and was then traded to the Chicago Blackhawks for a sixth-round pick in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft on March 10, 2003. Hašek played well for the Blackhawks in 2003–04, with a 2.11 GAA in 37 games.\n\nThe next season, Hašek played well for the Blackhawks, with a 2.22 GAA in 36 games. However, he was unable to maintain his form, and was replaced as Chicago's starting goaltender by Nikolai Khabibulin, who had been acquired by the Blackhawks in a trade with the Tampa Bay Lightning. Hašek was then traded to the Ottawa Senators on March 9, 2005, for a second-round draft pick in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nIn his first season with the Senators, Hašek played in 40 games, and posted a 2.26 GAA. He then missed the majority of the 2005–06 season after suffering a shoulder injury. He appeared in just five games for the Senators, and was traded to the Colorado Avalanche for Patrick Eaves, a second-round draft pick in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft, and a third-round pick in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft on September 25, 2005.\n\nHašek quickly returned to form with the Avalanche, playing in 54 games and posting a 2.22 GAA. In 2006–07, he played in 57 games, and posted a 2.30 GAA. Hašek was an important factor in the Avalanche's playoff run, as he posted a 1.65 GAA in eight games.\n\nOn June 19, 2007, Hašek signed a two-year contract extension with the Avalanche. The following season, he played in just 35 games due to a groin injury, and his GAA rose to 2.88. He was then sidelined for the rest of the season after having shoulder surgery.\n\nOn June 30, 2009, Hašek signed a two-year contract with the Detroit Red Wings. He recorded the first win of his Red Wings career on January 2, 2010, in a 3–1 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nOn January 1, 2011, Hašek was named the First Star of the Week for the week ending December 26. Hašek compiled a 3–0–0 record, a 0.67 goals-against average and a .984 save percentage. He led the Red Wings to their fifth four-game winning streak of the season. During the streak, Hašek stopped 135 of 138 shots and yielded only one goal in a span of 140 minutes and four seconds.\n\nOn January 20, 2011, Hašek was selected as the NHL's Third Star of the Week. He went 2–0–1 in three appearances, with both victories coming against Central Division rivals (January 14, 3–0 win at Chicago and January 16, 4–1 win at St. Louis), and recorded a 1.00 goals-against average and a .962 save percentage.\n\nHašek finished the 2010–11 season with a career-high 41 victories, just one win behind league leader Martin Brodeur.\n\nOn March 29, 2011, Hašek scored a goal against the Los Angeles Kings. The goal, a result of a breakaway due to an errant pass by Kings defenseman Slava Voynov, was the second of Hašek's career. His first goal was scored against the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2008. The goal also made him the oldest goaltender in NHL history to score a goal in a game. The record was previously held by Tommy Salo, who scored a goal in a game at the age of 35.\n\nOn May 31, 2011, Hašek underwent surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right shoulder.\n\nHašek was injured during the 2011–12 preseason, and on October 2, 2011, was placed on long-term injured reserve by the Red Wings. He returned from his injury to back up Ty Conklin for a game against the Phoenix Coyotes on November 29, 2011.\n\nOn July 5, 2012, Hašek signed a one-year, $2.05 million contract with the Florida Panthers. He was named the starting goaltender in the Panthers' inaugural game in the 2012–13 season against the New Jersey Devils. He was subsequently pulled in the first period after allowing 4 goals on 15 shots. He was replaced by Scott Clemmensen, and on January 24, 2013, Clemmensen was named as the Panthers' starting goaltender for the remainder of the season.\n\nHašek was placed on waivers by the Panthers on June 13, 2013. Hašek was then bought out from the final year of his contract on June 15, 2013. He was then signed by the Detroit Red Wings for the 2013–14 season to backup starter Jimmy Howard.\n\nHašek became an unrestricted free agent in the off-season, and on September 11, 2014, signed his first contract abroad, agreeing to a one-year deal with HC Pardubice of the Czech Extraliga. After one season in Pardubice, Hašek opted to continue in the Extraliga, signing a two-year deal with HC Vítkovice. In his second season with Vítkovice, Hašek helped his club claim its first league title since 1999, appearing in 15 playoff games. He left as a free agent to sign a one-year contract with HC Pardubice on June 19, 2017.\n\nHašek played for the Czech Republic at the 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 World Championships, winning bronze in 2004 and 2005. Hašek was the starting goaltender for the Czech Republic team that won the gold medal at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey.\n\nIn 2003, Hašek became a Canadian citizen, but had already represented the Czech Republic in international competition, and he was therefore eligible to play for either national team. On November 7, 2005, he announced that he would continue to represent the Czech Republic, even though he had been approached by the Canadian team and was eligible to play for Canada. Hašek's younger brother Ondřej also plays professional hockey.\n
