Gary, I don't know who or what the new "Oldsmobile" will be. At this point I have not even seen the car. I think they are planning to unveil it in the spring.\n\n\n\nWhat I would like to see would be an Olds branded CUV with the attitude of the current Enclave. If they can do that, I would buy one. If not, they will be back at square one in the CUV market.\n\n\n\nThe other big issue is the financial status of GM. Is it just teetering on the edge, or has it already fallen into the abyss? If they go bankrupt, will the Olds brand survive? There are a lot of question marks surrounding the new Olds.
