It's a good time to be an Air Jordan fan, because the kicks are coming in fast and heavy. The latest Jordan Brand basketball sneaker, the Air Jordan 5 Five Rings, hit shelves on Tuesday. This Jordan retro release features a reflective upper with the commemorative Olympic rings on the heel. It's available at Jordan Brand retailers in two colorways: "Green Glow" and "White/Metallic Silver-Glow."\n\nAs an early holiday treat, Nike is releasing a remastered version of the Air Max 1 to match the Air Max 1 Premium on Oct. 19. The sneaker's contemporary, Air Max-style tooling comes in a classy black and silver colorway and is accompanied by white laces. Look out for the remastered edition at Nike's various locations.\n\nHeading in a different direction is the new batch of Reebok Classics, with the Ryde and Royal collaborations. The collection features an urban-themed color palette of white, grey, blue and black. The sneakers also come with a gum sole and nubuck and suede materials. The Ryde is available for purchase at nike.com and the Reebok Classics website.\n\nSneakerheads rejoice, because the long-awaited retro of the Reebok Pump Omni Lite, designed by David Beckham, is finally out in stores. The Pump was first introduced in 1993 and became a popular sneaker of the 1990s, so it's no surprise that fans are eagerly awaiting its return.\n\nThis weekend's sneaker releases are a bit smaller than usual, but that doesn't mean there aren't any gems in the bunch.
