There’s no denying that cats can be evil. And cute. Sometimes you want them to be cute and not evil. It’s one of the many paradoxes of feline ownership. But I’m pretty sure that if a cat is being really, really cute and precious, then it must be plotting to kill something, if not you, then a house plant.\n\nCase in point: This cat being super sweet to a pillow. I mean, a cat on a pillow! Cuuuute. Oh, and that cat is also licking its own butthole.\n\nI like to imagine that the cat in the picture is watching over a shelf full of all his past victims. Like, you know, your garden plants.\n\n[via Buzzfeed]
