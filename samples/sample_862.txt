View Full Version : Dualshock 3 remote\n\ngravestal\n\nThe Sony PS3 console uses a standard bluetooth dongle to enable communication with a Dualshock 3 remote.\n\nThe Windows Bluetooth stack is generally a bit crap, so here are some instructions on getting the dongle working with OS X and the new Xbox 360 Bluetooth dongle:\n\n\n\nFirst of all you need a bluetooth dongle for Windows. I used a cheap one from a shop called Wom, and although I had problems getting it to work I eventually managed it, so these instructions are based on using that dongle, and you may not be able to follow them with any other.\n\n\n\nOn my Windows PC, I used the generic Windows Bluetooth drivers, but other drivers may work.\n\n\n\nSo:\n\nPlug in the dongle.\n\nOpen up the device manager (Control Panel > System > Hardware > Device Manager).\n\nFind the dongle, and right click on it.\n\nClick on Properties.\n\nClick on the Details tab.\n\nClick on the Property button (on the right hand side).\n\nScroll down to the MS info section and find the Default Format and Default Device Class. Make sure the settings are as below:\n\n\n\nDefault Format: Unicode UTF-16LE\n\nDefault Device Class: 0x07\n\nAfter all of that has been done, turn off your PC, unplug the dongle, and plug it into your Mac.\n\nOn the Mac, turn the Bluetooth dongle on (via a small switch on the dongle), and then open up the System Preferences.\n\nClick on the Bluetooth icon.\n\nYou should now see the dongle appear as a connected device. Select it and you're away!\n\nFor the PS3, you need to open up the System Preferences (via the Apple menu).\n\nClick on the Bluetooth icon.\n\nSelect the PS3 from the Devices list and click on the button that says "Advanced".\n\nThe following settings need to be configured:\n\n\n\nCharacter Set: Unicode UTF-16LE\n\nCodepage: 437\n\nYou should be all set to go!
