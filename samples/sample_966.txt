There’s nothing like a warm dish of vegetarian lasagna to please a crowd. This recipe is as easy to make as the traditional Italian version, but it’s healthier because it uses vegetables instead of beef or sausage. I usually top it with my own “Italian-style” cheese blend, which makes a quick and tasty topping. —Tina Wilhite, Tulsa, Oklahoma
