ISLAMABAD: Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said on Tuesday that the federal cabinet would take up the issue of missing persons in the country next week.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the National Press Club, Nisar said that he would not shy away from discussing the issue with the judiciary and other institutions as all of them were part of the state.\n\nHe, however, reiterated that most of the people who had gone missing had done so on their own volition and were not in the custody of the state.\n\nThe interior minister said that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif would inaugurate the Margalla Police Training College today and the PM would also address the Senate tomorrow.\n\nNisar said that both houses of parliament would discuss the measures taken by the government for the security of journalists in the wake of the recent attack on senior journalist Hamid Mir.\n\nHe said that he had tasked the provincial governments to make sure that no journalist was threatened in the name of national security.\n\nOn the issue of Kalabagh dam, the minister said that the federal government would review the issue in consultation with the provinces, adding that it was the only solution to address the water shortage in the country.\n\nHowever, Nisar maintained that the project would be implemented only after a consensus was reached.\n\n"There are other options which can be pursued first, including rainwater harvesting, so why should we go for Kalabagh dam right now? Kalabagh dam is not on our priority list," he said.\n\nThe minister further stated that efforts would be made to end load-shedding by the end of the year.\n\nCh Nisar Ali Khan to inaugurate Margalla Police Training College today #NPCConf15 pic.twitter.com/pjKir7IVOo â€” Minister for Interior (@interiornews) August 4, 2015\n\nHe said that the ministry had already held meetings with the federal and provincial governments and all the stakeholders to discuss the issue of load-shedding.\n\nHe said that the meeting discussed options such as forming a high-powered committee, expanding the scope of the policy, increasing transmission and distribution losses, adding that measures would be taken to deal with energy theft.\n\nThe minister said that he had tasked the concerned authorities to increase the supply of electricity, adding that he was in favour of privatisation.\n\nResponding to a question regarding the extension in the tenure of Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, Nisar said that he was not opposed to an extension in the tenure of the top judge.\n\nHe, however, said that the chief justice should not have become a member of the Judicial Commission without consulting the prime minister and other chief ministers.\n\nThe minister said that Iftikhar Chaudhry was already eligible for the post of a judge of the Supreme Court at the age of 60 years.\n\n"If he has applied for a further extension, then I think it should be decided by the prime minister and other chief ministers," he added.\n\nHe said that the issue would be discussed during the upcoming cabinet meeting.
