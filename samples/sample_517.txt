From 1853 to 1860 he attended the Shamakhy religious school, and then later at the Shamakhi Muslim Boarding School. In 1862, he studied at the Nizamiyya Madrasah in Ganja. At first, he worked as a teacher, but then he moved to Tiflis where he studied at the Caucasian Muslim Gymnasium from 1864 to 1870. Then he returned to Shamakhi and taught at his old school until 1876, when he left for Tiflis again. In 1877, he moved to Baku and worked as a deputy editor and later as an editor at the "Hayat" newspaper. He lived in Tiflis for a third time from 1878 to 1884, and then returned to Baku, where he established a publishing house named "Abdulgaffar", which published the first Azerbaijani newspaper "Bakinskiy Listok". He died in 1889.\n\nRafibeyli is considered the founder of the Azerbaijani novel. He is also the author of numerous plays. His best-known plays include "Mumtaz Khan" (1882), "Seyid Huseyn" (1886), "Arshin Mal Alan" (1884), "Khanlar Bahadur" (1886), and "Shirin" (1887).

As well as plays, he also wrote novels and short stories such as "Koroghlu" (1872), "Xirayi" (1872), "Jabal" (1872), "Dashtadem" (1873), "Shah Abbas and Kamaleddin Efendi" (1879), "Bahadur Khan Shaku" (1880), "Shah Mansur" (1882), "Shirin" (1886), "Sulthan Mahmud" (1888), "Dervish Khudadat" (1886), "Agha Mammad Hasan" (1888), "Qataghani" (1889), "Khurshidbanu Natavan" (1889), "Nebiy" (1890), "Unsulli" (1890), and "Gulbakhor" (1890).\n\nHis two most famous works are "Seyid Huseyn" (1886) and "Arshin Mal Alan" (1884). "Seyid Huseyn" was written after the Karabakh liberation movement (1830-1835) and was first staged in 1873. It is a work of realism and it depicts the life of the Azerbaijani feudal landlord Seyid Huseyn. It was written in the tradition of oriental tales and was praised for its artistic value and the depiction of people. "Arshin Mal Alan" is a work of realist-idealistic nature. It tells about the greed of people and how this brings misfortune to them. This work was praised for the beauty of its language and for the pathos of its characters.\n\nIn addition to his plays and novels, Rafibeyli translated several plays by Russian playwrights into Azerbaijani.\n\nRaf"
