This is a great, solid, wooden toy. We've only had it for a couple of weeks, but we've already gotten a lot of use out of it. We wanted it mainly because of the "swing your baby" aspect of it (if that makes sense). It has a very high, sturdy seat, and the rest of it is quite high and wide. The seat is very solid. You can have it swinging for a long time with very little effort. It can be very soft, and you can "rock" your baby on it, or you can make it more "swinging", if that makes sense. You can adjust the ropes easily, which is great, and they're very sturdy, but not hard to adjust. The seat is very wide and deep, and fits my son really well. He's 3 months old and is quite chunky, but he has plenty of room. And the fact that it's wood means that it will last for a very long time. It doesn't look like it's for "babies" either. Even though it's simple, it's a very nice looking piece of furniture.
