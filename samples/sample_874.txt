By Rachel Katz\n\nI want to thank everyone for their interest in the Food for Thought events this week and to announce that we are taking the event off of our regular weekly rotation.\n\nThe outcome of the events at Chicago and at NYU—the students are going to be able to pursue what they were hoping to pursue from the first moment of the project—this is good for the Food for Thought project, good for the students, good for the nonprofit, and good for the University.\n\nWhat happened this week?\n\nThe point of this week was to get information about the types of events that would work best for our audience—our audience being the students. And after seeing how the event in Chicago went, we decided to go ahead with this week’s events as planned.\n\nThe second event at NYU went very well. The student population at NYU is very different than the population at the University of Chicago. It is a lot smaller and it is not a natural fit for our events.\n\nWe want to serve the students and do so in a way that works for them and so after talking to the students in New York, we decided to move Food for Thought off of our weekly rotation for the fall. It is just not a good fit for them right now.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nWe’re trying to make sure we’re moving Food for Thought forward and not backward. The goal here is not to try and find a place for Food for Thought that it will fit in, the goal is to find a place for Food for Thought that it will fit in.\n\nIf we have another event at the University of Chicago that’s a success, we’ll move forward and try to get one at another school.\n\nWe’ll also be using the extra time we have this week to work on logistics and see if there is anything we need to change in the way we organize our events in the future.\n\nWhat’s next for your organization?\n\nWe’re still going to be fundraising and we’re still going to be putting on events, but we’re going to be using the extra time this week to come up with new ideas for future events.\n\nHow can students get involved with Food for Thought?\n\nStudents can volunteer at our events. We also have a contact on our website for students who are interested in volunteering. And we’re looking for ideas and we’re always interested in hearing from students.\n\nIs the Food for Thought logo going to change?\n\nIt’s not going to change anytime soon, but we are looking into other things we can do to get more publicity for the Food for Thought project.\n\nWe’re looking into new ways to do fundraising. We’re looking at getting the word out there more, and it’s all because of what the students have done at these events this week.\n\nIf students had one question to ask you, what would it be?\n\n“Why do you do what you do?” I think it’s because when I was in college, it was really hard to make friends, it was really hard to figure out where I fit in, and it was really hard to figure out where I was going to work. And so now I’m trying to help students be successful.\n\nAnd even though I wasn’t successful when I was in college, I’m just trying to pay it forward.\n\nhttp://www.uchicago.edu/student-life/info/food-thought/
