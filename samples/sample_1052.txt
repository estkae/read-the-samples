- From youtube.com "It's hot and dusty as Jay makes his way along a dusty road, heading for a ranch near the Texas border.\n\nAccording to the map, the ranch is located just past a bridge and a little creek. It's a great-looking ranch house, but there's no one home. He steps inside the barn and finds what he's looking for: fresh hay. Perfect!\n\nJay loves to make hay, but not just any hay - he loves to make it out of old cotton cloth, specifically socks. He calls his project "hayscaping."\n\nJay takes out two socks and starts by pinching them at the top and then twisting them together. It takes a bit of practice to get it just right, but it's really fun once you get the hang of it.\n\nOnce he's got a long strand, he'll braid it together. He braids three strands at a time to get a good length. Once it's long enough, he'll braid it together into one long strand.\n\nThis is the first of three videos in the series. In the other two, he'll show you how to weave and even create a little frame for the top of the hay, giving it a neat finishing touch."
