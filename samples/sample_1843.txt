And for all the debate about how he won't be able to take the next step to being a more dynamic NFL QB, I would contend that he never has to take a step at all because he does so much of what is asked of him.\n\n\n\nHis arm isn't going to get a lot better and that's probably the biggest knock on him in the NFL. But with his understanding of where to go with the ball, his accuracy, his football IQ, his footwork and mechanics, his ability to read defenses, his smarts and intangibles... Vandenberg might actually be pretty well-suited for the kind of system that translates well into the NFL.\n\n\n\nA big-armed athlete is fun to watch but they're the ones who get drafted in the 2nd round and are always the one or two missing pieces on a struggling team. Meanwhile, a smart, accurate, tough QB who is still developing could very well go in the 4th or 5th round and may not even be the best QB on his team in college but he could be very, very good.\n\n\n\nThe Saints could use that guy, in my opinion. And, if you're drafting in the 2nd round, it might be hard to not reach for that guy.\n\n\n\nOn that note, what do you think are Vandenberg's NFL-caliber strengths?\n\nThis is how I feel too, Vandy's QB rating is always low and then he turns around and throws 3 TD's. The Saints are a team that needs a QB that has a big arm that can make every throw, and that includes down the field. They have a great offense already, I'm just not sure if it fits Drew Brees well anymore. The Seahawks QB Russell Wilson, a QB that isn't a great pocket passer, can be good. I think the Saints have to address the QB situation even if it's through the draft.
