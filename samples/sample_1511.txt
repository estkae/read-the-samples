"Elderly fall risk 'skyrocketed' in UK hospitals\n\nElderly people are being placed at "huge risk" by NHS hospitals, a report warns.\n\nAn investigation into the state of care of the elderly found patients being given the wrong drugs, going without vital care, and not being treated with dignity.\n\nExperts from the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD) found that while some services were good, there was "much variation" in the way hospitals cared for the elderly.\n\nThe report, compiled from statistics on admissions in 2011-12 and patient experiences, revealed that over a third of people admitted to hospital in the last year of life fell while in the care of hospital staff.\n\nThe figure rose to 44% in the last two weeks of life, when patients are often admitted for palliative care.\n\nThis happened despite recommendations that patients are to be offered falls prevention assessments, and given safety aids if they need them.\n\nResearchers found that nearly a third of patients given medication were given the wrong dose, with 15% given less than half of the prescribed dose.\n\nThis included children, teenagers, women in the last three months of pregnancy, patients in mental health wards and patients with kidney failure.\n\nPoor care of the elderly was found in large hospitals and specialist units, such as hospices, with variations in care found in hospitals across the UK.\n\nAn NHS England spokesman said: "The NHS works hard to give the very best care to all patients, including those who are elderly, and these findings reflect that.\n\n"However, as the report highlights, some patients can receive care that is not of the standard they expect or deserve, and there is clearly more work to be done to ensure we provide consistent and safe care for all our patients.\n\n"In common with all healthcare systems, the NHS faces challenges in ensuring consistent care for patients with increasingly complex needs.\n\n"While some trusts are facing such challenges in a unique way, others are also working hard to ensure that all patients get the same level of safe and high quality care.\n\n"We expect all hospitals to examine and learn from the report's findings, which will help to drive forward improvements in care and patient safety."\n\nJoanne Stuart, chief executive of the Caring Choices Campaign, said: "The NHS is so much better at providing care for people in hospital than it used to be, but the report shows that a lot more work needs to be done to make sure that all elderly people get high quality, consistent care in hospital.\n\n"All too often, patients don't get the kind of care they deserve and we need to stop this happening.\n\n"Hospitals must take action to make sure that care is more consistent, with elderly people and their families having a better idea of what to expect and what they can do to make sure they get the best possible care.\n\n"We would also urge the NHS to adopt the NICE guidelines on care of the dying, which will make a real difference to care in the last days and hours of life."\n\nDr Peter Carter, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), said: "While this report shows the majority of older people are getting good care in hospital, it also shows that for some the experience is a long way from good enough.\n\n"That's why the RCN, alongside the Department of Health and others, is looking to see how we can improve care, so we see fewer preventable hospital admissions and fewer falls and delays in people getting treatment."\n\nLast month, the chief inspector of hospitals, Professor Sir Mike Richards, warned that the NHS needs to provide better care for the elderly to reduce the number of avoidable deaths.\n\nHis call came as figures from the Office for National Statistics showed there were 21,866 "excess deaths" of people aged 75 and over in England in 2011.\n\nThe number of elderly people dying in hospital has also risen by 35% in a decade, according to the figures.\n\nSir Mike said: "We know that people receive better care when they're closer to home. In the majority of cases the treatment people receive in hospital is good, but as we get older it becomes increasingly important to get the care right, because we have more complex needs."\n\nSir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, said: "Most patients are very satisfied with the care they receive, but we need to see more consistency to ensure all people get the best possible care, when they need it."\n\nA Department of Health spokesman said: "The quality of end-of-life care is hugely important to us and we expect hospitals to be looking at this in detail to ensure patients receive the best possible care at the end of their lives.\n\n"We are also strengthening care of the dying with the imminent publication of NICE guidelines which will set out good practice in care of the dying."\n\nCopyright Press Association 2013
