"Instead of clashing against national adversaries, the 2014 Sochi Olympics will have a more international focus than usual. The Olympic events include representatives from nations that are notoriously difficult to connect with, such as North Korea.\n\nThe Olympics are not the only global event coming up in 2014. Others include:\n\nPolitical changes in the Middle East (including elections in Libya and Iraq)\n\nThailand’s political upheaval\n\nVenezuela’s violent clashes\n\nThe Super Bowl\n\n2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia\n\nOngoing political conflict in Ukraine\n\nKorea’s succession of power\n\nAfghanistan’s presidential election\n\nIndia’s general elections\n\nThe release of the new “Star Wars” movie\n\nAthletic competitions at the Commonwealth Games\n\nNaval standoff between India and China over the South China Sea\n\nEconomic conflicts between the U.S. and Russia\n\nWho will win the “no-holds-barred” brawl for control of Crimea?\n\nUnrest in Iraq\n\nMiss America\n\nFifty Shades of Grey\n\nHockey and figure skating at the Winter Olympics\n\nExpect these events to have both positive and negative effects on the global economy and security. The Olympics will likely promote cooperation and stability in a region that is currently experiencing political and economic uncertainty. But North Korea is known for staging provocative actions, so there is always the potential for disruption.\n\nThe Super Bowl is often used as a barometer of the U.S. economy because it generates huge amounts of revenue. The World Cup may not have the same influence, but it is also a huge event that brings together nations around the world to play a game.\n\nThe country’s response to political change in Egypt during the Arab Spring, which initially boosted stock markets, was a notable economic example of the power of international relations.\n\nPolitical and social tensions between India and Pakistan over disputed territories could also escalate and adversely affect the security of the region.\n\nThe United States and the European Union have major sanctions on Iran, but these measures have not yet significantly affected the country’s economy. Even so, Iran’s leader warned of dire consequences if the U.S. imposes new sanctions. Iran’s economy could be badly damaged if additional sanctions were placed on its oil exports.\n\nIt is also possible that Saudi Arabia, which has a strong interest in keeping oil prices low, could push Iran out of the global energy market, which could send oil prices higher.\n\nWhile these international events should be closely monitored for potential disruptions to economic stability, the developments also have the potential to be a positive influence on the global economy.\n\nThe election in Afghanistan will be another political development that has the potential to influence the country’s economic stability. There are a number of warlords, including some with close ties to the Taliban, who could benefit from the power shift.\n\nThe latest iteration of the Star Wars movie, which could be another blockbuster, will boost consumer spending in the United States and other countries. It is also likely to spawn more toy sales.\n\nSome countries could be harmed by the release of the movie. China, for example, could ban its citizens from going to see the movie because of the country’s strict restrictions on the kinds of content that can be shown in its theaters.\n\nThe impact of the film’s release will not be limited to the countries that are named above. It will be interesting to see how well the movie performs in many countries around the world. The film could spur a lot of tourism, especially in Europe, which will benefit the tourism industry in the U.S. and other countries.\n\nOne of the biggest economic events of 2014 will be the impending clash between the United States and the European Union over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nOn the other hand, if a negotiated solution can be reached between the U.S. and the EU, the sanctions on Russia could be eased or even lifted, which would have a positive effect on the global economy.\n\nThis is because the EU buys a significant amount of Russian oil. If the EU imposes additional sanctions on Russia, the price of oil could rise.\n\nGlobal Unrest in 2014\n\nSome other international events to watch in 2014 include:\n\n(For more about the global unrest in 2014, click here.)\n\nIs the Russian economy in crisis? It could be. It depends on the results of the conflict with the Ukraine, the loss of energy exports to Europe and how the sanctions that have already been imposed will affect the country’s economy.\n\nFor the global economy, however, the most serious potential risk is the naval standoff between India and China over the South China Sea. If the conflict escalates, the Asian economy could be hit hard.\n\nOther than that, the biggest impact on the global economy in 2014 will be the numerous domestic economic issues that need to be addressed. These include the political stalemate in Washington, high unemployment, low wage growth and other problems.\n\nStay informed about the issues that affect you the most.
