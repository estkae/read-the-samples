Do you ever think about what you would say to a homeless veteran if you met one?\n\nThe post, written by the Navy's current senior enlisted leader, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Mike Stevens, was originally posted on the official Navy blog on Jan. 21, and has been reposted on the official Facebook page since then.\n\nIn it, Stevens breaks down the percentage of homeless veterans from each branch of the military, and highlights some startling facts about homeless female veterans.\n\nAccording to the post, 31 percent of homeless veterans served in the Army, 18 percent in the Navy, 18 percent in the Air Force, 20 percent in the Marine Corps, and 1 percent in the Coast Guard.\n\nStevens also mentioned that females account for 10 percent of all homeless veterans.\n\n"To be a homeless woman of any age is an unthinkable state of existence. But to be a homeless woman in the United States of America, a country with abundant resources and vast public compassion, should be unconscionable," Stevens wrote.\n\nHe added that female homeless veterans face a higher level of traumatic issues and psychological disorders than males.\n\n"They have been raped, assaulted, subjected to abuse both physically and mentally," he wrote. "They have seen the worst that humankind can inflict on itself. And yet, they stand strong, their heads held high."\n\nStevens closed the post by saying: "As we focus our attention on homeless veterans, let's not forget the remarkable women who are part of this epidemic."
