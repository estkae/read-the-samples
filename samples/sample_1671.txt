Britain's economy is entering a dangerous new phase as the fallout from the vote to leave the EU sets in, according to leading City economists.\n\nFour of the five major forecasters said in the aftermath of the referendum result that they now expected the UK to slip into recession in the next year, warning that the economy would struggle to make up for the hit from weaker business and consumer confidence.\n\nA clutch of new data and surveys since the vote have shown that the economy contracted in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, and the longer-term prospects are uncertain.\n\nIn their verdicts on the data, the economists painted a picture of a "marked slowdown in growth" at the start of the second half of 2016.\n\nHoward Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said that "even a mild recession may now be a realistic possibility".\n\nIt was, he said, "in large part due to mounting fears over a possible recession and the future shape of the UK economy following the Brexit vote".\n\nDiane Swonk, founder of DS Economics, said that while the economy was likely to weather the storm, "economic growth is likely to be weaker and more fragile going forward".\n\nInvestec chief economist Philip Shaw said: "I think we're in for a rocky road. We've seen already the most startling reaction in the world stock markets in history.\n\n"It's very easy to envisage the consumer taking a pause for thought and the business community becoming more risk-averse."\n\nA quarter-point cut to the Bank of England base rate was expected next month but Mr Shaw said that the possibility of a recession had changed the outlook for monetary policy.\n\nHoward Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said that "even a mild recession may now be a realistic possibility" (Bloomberg)\n\nAll four of the major forecasters, including the Bank, have cut their forecasts for UK GDP growth in 2016 and 2017 since the vote.\n\nIn its latest analysis of the short-term outlook, the EY Item Club predicted that the economy would contract by 0.1pc in the third quarter and by 0.2pc in the fourth.\n\nA separate survey of business opinion by the Institute of Directors said that the fallout from Brexit was a major concern for its members, while a separate business confidence survey by the CBI found a similar mood of pessimism.\n\nFigures from the Office for National Statistics this week showed that retail sales dropped 0.7pc in June, the sharpest fall since 2010.\n\nThe data, taken with a survey from the British Retail Consortium, pointed to a "big squeeze on consumer spending".\n\nHSBC this week cut its forecasts for consumer spending in the UK this year, saying that the real household income squeeze was likely to take a "sizeable chunk out of consumption over the next couple of years".\n\nConsumer confidence in Britain was the weakest in the G10 this month (Reuters)\n\nThe EY Item Club said that the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote was "the key factor".\n\n"The UK economy is likely to be buffeted by uncertainty and lack of confidence, with any external risks likely to add to domestic concerns," it said.\n\nThe Bank of England, in a widely-praised move, cut its base rate by 0.25pc to 0.25pc on Thursday in a bid to shore up confidence.\n\nBut Mr Archer said that this action had come too late to prevent a worsening of the outlook.\n\nHe said that the governor Mark Carney was "almost certainly right in the sense that lower interest rates are needed to provide support to confidence, but they are not needed yet".\n\nSimon Wells, chief UK economist at HSBC, said: "Looking forward, there are no obvious sources of growth to offset any headwinds."\n\nHe said that the recent boost to household spending from lower oil prices was likely to prove short-lived, while business investment and net trade would not make up for the slowdown.\n\nFigures released this week showed that Britain's trade deficit widened in May as exports fell by 2.6pc and imports rose by 3.6pc.\n\nBank of England Governor Mark Carney, has cut interest rates to a record low 0.25pc (Getty Images)\n\n"Net trade is likely to detract from growth in the quarters ahead, with consumer spending weakening as real incomes come under pressure from the further rise in inflation triggered by the sterling depreciation," he said.\n\n"The greater risk to the near-term outlook is that businesses become so worried about the outlook that they rein in their investment plans, both in terms of equipment and the supply chain.\n\n"While this is unlikely to happen in the short-term, it would be more likely in the second half of next year if the economic outlook becomes clearer and more negative."\n\nMarianne Bauer, chief economist at Berenberg, said that there would be a "sharp" economic slowdown as businesses put investment plans on hold.\n\n"We expect the downturn to be much sharper than previous recessions," she said.\n\n"Uncertainty should keep growth subdued, as will a lack of confidence. For instance, we believe that the weak stock market performance reflects high levels of uncertainty about how the UK's economy will perform in the future."
