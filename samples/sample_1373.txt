The relationship between trade and economic growth is a long-standing question. To what extent does trade contribute to economic growth and what are the mechanisms that explain this relationship? This book is the result of an extensive collaboration between researchers in Brazil and France. It presents an innovative methodology that links trade and economic growth to the performance of the Brazilian manufacturing industry, a key sector of the Brazilian economy.\n\nThis book analyses the relationship between international trade and economic growth for a large sample of countries over more than two decades. By relying on a panel of time series, the authors of this volume are able to detect some of the mechanisms that contribute to explaining the impact of trade on economic growth. They identify the effects of trade on industrial development, economic inequality, and on the environment.\n\nThis book will be of particular interest to policy makers, academics and researchers with an interest in International Economics, Trade Policy, International Trade, Economic Development and Brazilian Politics.
