Eclipse Juno ships with a new version of the EMF Model to Text Generator (EMFMTG) based on EMF 2.8.1. EMFMTG is a utility for generating textual representations of EMF models. This version includes support for linking models with their code generation templates. A Model to Text (MTT) generator allows developers to generate textual representations of a modelâ€™s metamodel. The output is a textual document which describes the contents of the model. This tool is most useful when developers need to provide documentation or export model elements to other tools. For example, the generators can be used to create a textual report or to export elements to an Eclipse plugin.
