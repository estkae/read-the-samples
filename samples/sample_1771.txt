"\n\n© Copyright John B. Allen\n\nEucharis is the generic name for a genus of plants in the Amaryllis family, Amaryllidaceae. The most common species is Eucharis grandiflora, also known as the Peruvian lily. Other species in the genus Eucharis include E. petiolata, E. pallidiflora, E. cornucopioides, E. cusackii, and E. formosa.\n\nPlants in the genus Eucharis are found throughout the Andes from southern Ecuador to northern Argentina. They are tuberous, terrestrial plants, usually growing to a height of about 20 inches (50 cm). They have long, smooth, ribbon-like leaves, and small green flowers, usually with one prominent yellow spot. Most species are very attractive and popular in cultivation.\n\nPlants in the genus Eucharis are of interest to horticulturalists and also are grown as food. In Chile the tubers of E. grandiflora are harvested for consumption, and may be cooked, fermented or eaten raw. Tubers may also be pickled.\n\nOther common names in Chile for Eucharis grandiflora include flor de mayo (“May flower”), romerillo, peonía, peonía blanca (“white peony”), and “señorita” (“miss”).\n\nThe seeds of Eucharis grandiflora are also edible.\n\nPhotos © Copyright John B.
