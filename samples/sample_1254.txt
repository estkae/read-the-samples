Newcastle set to snap up Kagawa on loan\n\n\n\nMarseille are set to allow Shinji Kagawa to join Newcastle on loan in the new year.\n\nThe Japanese star was considered one of the biggest stars in European football after helping Borussia Dortmund to back-to-back Bundesliga titles and two successive appearances in the Champions League Final.\n\nHowever, he has struggled for form in Ligue 1 and may be forced to move on for a second successive season after struggling to make an impact at Manchester United following his move from the Westfalenstadion in June 2012.\n\nScroll down for video\n\n\n\nSet to return: Kagawa (right) could be heading back to England with Newcastle next month\n\nKagawa is understood to be a target for Newcastle as they prepare for life back in the Barclays Premier League.\n\n\n\nMarseille are keen to take the 24-year-old on loan, with the move being sanctioned by the player's representatives, who have the authority to broker the deal.\n\nManager Elie Baup said: 'If he goes, it is for a loan.\n\n'I think there is a club interested in him, but I do not want to name it.\n\n'We will do everything to keep him with us. He is a young player, a player of quality, but it is an important decision.\n\n'He is also a professional. So if he leaves it will be in a favourable situation.\n\n'But he is training well with us and it is very good.'\n\n\n\nKagawa, who has scored six goals in 13 Ligue 1 appearances, may have to leave the Stade Velodrome in January as Marseille aim to keep ahold of their star assets and reach the knockout stage of the Champions League.\n\nRivalling United: Danny Welbeck and Shinji Kagawa (right) played in the 4-0 defeat by Liverpool on Monday
