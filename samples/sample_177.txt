Abraham Bredius\n\nAbraham Bredius (1855â€“1927) was a Dutch art collector and author of art books, known for his critical approach. He was especially a specialist in Dutch old masters, and the attribution of paintings.\n\nBredius was born on 2 July 1855 in Amsterdam, the son of a diamond merchant. He studied law at the University of Amsterdam and received his doctorate in 1879. He became a member of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in 1878. He and his brother, Pieter Frederik Bredius, ran the diamond business for a time after their father's death in 1895. In 1899 he and his brother retired from business and moved to the town of Laren. His brother committed suicide in 1905.\n\nIn 1911, Bredius published his first art book, "Rembrandt: een monografie" (Rembrandt: a monograph), a scholarly study of Rembrandt's oeuvre, based on careful research of the existing works and contemporary documentation. His other publications include "Jan Steen" (1914), "Frans Hals" (1916), "De groote schilderijen in het Mauritshuis" (The large paintings in the Mauritshuis) (1923), "A descriptive catalogue of the works of Peter Paul Rubens" (1925) and "De schilderselders in Nederland gedurende de XVIIe en XVIIIe eeuw" (The painters of the Netherlands in the 17th and 18th centuries) (1927). The last book was published posthumously by his daughter.\n\nBredius was married to a daughter of Cornelis Hofstede de Groot, the art historian. Their daughter, Wilhelmina Bredius, was also an art historian.\n\nBredius was an art collector, and owned works by such artists as Frans Hals, Rembrandt and Jan Steen. He purchased many paintings and drawings at auction, and was considered to have the best collection of old masters in the Netherlands. The collection was put up for sale after his death, and many of the paintings found their way into museum collections. Some of his books are still available, as is the catalogue of his collection.\n
