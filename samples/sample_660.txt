NEW YORK (Reuters) - A magnitude 6.9 earthquake hit the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific on Thursday, the U.S. Geological Survey said.\n\nThe quake was centred at a depth of more than 400 km (250 miles), about 130 km (80 miles) southwest of the capital Honiara, and struck at 1:52 p.m. local time (0852 GMT), the USGS said.\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said there was no threat of a tsunami.\n\nThe USGS said the quake was relatively shallow and spread out, so it was unlikely to cause significant damage.
