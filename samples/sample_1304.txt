"Usual Magistrate & ORT Reporter, Osisioma, Magistrate Court of Asa Local Government Area, Kogi State, Mr. Uthman El-Farouq, has denied taking bribe from a deceased old woman, Mrs. Aderonke Alaka.\n\nEl-Farouq, who made the denial during interrogation at the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID), Lokoja, on Thursday, said he had never known the deceased before her death.\n\nAccording to him, he did not receive a petition from the deceased and that the signature in the petition, which is part of his evidence at the police station, was not his signature.\n\nEl-Farouq said: “I do not know Aderonke Alaka. The signature in the petition is not mine. I have never known her before her death. It was God that was my strength.”\n\nHe denied the allegation of the state’s Minister of Works and Infrastructure, Chief Sunday Abalo, that he had extorted money from the late Mrs. Alaka before she died.\n\nHe said: “It is a lie. The person they are talking about has never been to my court. I have never taken a kobo from her. The claim by the Minister is not true.”\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the minister had accused the Usual Magistrate of extorting N100,000 from the late Mrs. Alaka before she died.\n\nThe minister, who had later apologised for the accusation, had said that the late Mrs. Alaka had died from grief and embarrassment after the magistrate demanded the bribe from her.\n\nAbalo had said: “I know Mrs. Alaka was with her son at Asa’s Medical Centre when they sent her to our Ministry of Health.\n\n“The family was shocked to find out that a demand of N100,000 was made to them for surgery for their mother.\n\n“She refused to pay the amount because of her pride and the family was not able to find that amount.\n\n“The family was trying to raise money to take the woman for treatment. The woman died from the shock of the demand of money from the Usual Court,” he said.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the minister had on January 18 accused the magistrate of asking for N500,000 from Mrs. Alaka before she could see her son, Adekunle Alaka, who was in detention for allegedly breaching the state’s environmental law.\n\nMrs. Alaka had died of grief after her son was detained for several days for the alleged offence.\n\nThe minister, who did not explain why Mrs. Alaka had not been taken to the Usual Magistrate, said the matter would be further investigated by the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, who visited the state recently.\n\nAbalo said the late Mrs. Alaka was at the Medical Centre in Asa, Kogi, and that they were treating her until the intervention of the magistrate.\n\nAbalo also explained that he took the decision to release Alaka’s dead body after receiving a letter from the Usual Magistrate demanding that his corpse be released to him.\n\n“I personally followed up the matter after receiving the letter from Usual Magistrate. I asked our officers at Asa to locate the late Alaka’s corpse.\n\n“When they found the corpse, they released it to the Usual Magistrate. I have no problem with that.”\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the state’s police command had also received a petition from Alaka’s family accusing El-Farouq of demanding money from them before they could take the corpse of their mother.\n\nThe late Mrs. Alaka had been buried in the village without her children having seen her body.\n\nThe petition had accused El-Farouq of having the corpse of their mother in his house and that he was demanding N500,000 from the family to release the corpse for burial.\n\nThe body of Mrs. Alaka was later exhumed from El-Farouq’s house.\n\nThe late Mrs. Alaka’s husband, Sunday Alaka, said he had sent N30,000 to El-Farouq through a courier to have his wife’s body released for burial.\n\nHe said the Usual Magistrate had claimed that his wife had written a letter to him, seeking treatment for an ailment, which he could not read.\n\nAlaka said: “I want my wife’s body released for burial so that I can have a permanent resting place for her.\n\n“The body was supposed to be released after a short time but it was not until the intervention of the ministry of Works and Infrastructure that the corpse was released.”\n\nEl-Farouq had also been accused of extorting money from people before they can be granted bail by the court.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Usual Magistrate, in a bid to prevent his arrest by the police, had gone into hiding.\n\nThe state’s police command had at a news conference declared El-Farouq wanted, following a petition sent to them by the Usual Magistrate himself.\n\nThe command had said that the Usual Magistrate had confessed that he took bribe from the late Mrs. Aderonke Alaka before her death.\n\nThe command’s spokesperson, Asinim Butswat, had said: “We received a petition from the Usual Magistrate.\n\n“He was complaining of a petition from a person. He said he has been collecting money from people before they can be granted bail by the court.”\n\nButswat had also told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the state’s Commissioner of Police, Mr. Amba Asad, had ordered an investigation into the matter.\n\nHe said: “The command got a petition from Usual Magistrate Uthman El-Farouq.\n\n“The Magistrate has confessed that he collected money from people who needed to be granted bail by the court.\n\n“The Commissioner of Police has ordered that an investigation be carried out on the matter.”\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Usual Magistrate, in a petition sent to the state’s Police Commissioner, had accused some policemen of demanding bribe from him before he can be granted bail.\n\nEl-Farouq said: “A police officer and his colleague called me on a particular day and said they wanted to collect money for themselves.\n\n“The police officer came with another police officer and they said they want money for themselves.”\n\nEl-Farouq had alleged that the two police officers had refused to release him on bail unless he paid them.\n\nHe said: “The police officers asked me to pay them N50,000 each to help me be granted bail.\n\n“I said to them that I do not have the money and they said I should tell the court that I do not have money to grant me bail.”\n\nThe Usual Magistrate had also asked for protection from the police for him not to be lynched by angry citizens over the death of Mrs. Alaka.
