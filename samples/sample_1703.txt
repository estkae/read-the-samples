BERKELEY, Calif. â€“ With 60 seconds remaining in what proved to be a 74-63 victory over the UC Santa Barbara men's basketball team, senior guard Matt Bradley calmly walked towards the free-throw line with a chance to put the finishing touches on a difficult week for the Gauchos.\n\nIn a show of strength, UCSB fans took advantage of the opportunity to cheer Bradley as loud as possible as he lined up for his second free throw.\n\nAfter Bradley sunk the first shot, he turned to the fans and gestured towards the sky. The gesture, a tribute to Bradley's late father, didn't go unnoticed.\n\nBradley's teammates and coaches quickly joined him, forming a circle of support as the players and fans chanted "Matt, Matt, Matt" together.\n\n"It was an emotional game, and I think the emotions just took over," Bradley said. "I didn't expect it to be that loud. I was very surprised by that. They were there for me."\n\nJust days after his father passed away, Bradley gave his best performance of the season, scoring a career-high 22 points and hitting five three-pointers.\n\n"Matt was amazing," head coach Bob Williams said. "I know he's going through a tough time and you really never know how kids are going to handle things like that. It takes a special person to go out and play like he did. I'm just proud of him."\n\nA day earlier, the 20-year-old junior spent his first Christmas without his father, Rod Bradley.\n\nBradley lost his father to cancer after a year-long battle with the disease. A professor in the History and Anthropology Department at UCSB, Bradley was known for his easy-going demeanor and his deep love of basketball.\n\n"I'd just like to thank all of the fans for their support during the game," Bradley said. "That helped a lot."\n\nBradley came out hot, making his first four three-point attempts, two of which came on back-to-back possessions as the game got underway.\n\n"Matt's a tough kid and he wanted to play," Williams said. "It was the first time he's had to deal with anything like this and it was pretty difficult for him."\n\nHe'd go on to finish the game with a career-high nine field goals and two free throws, while connecting on five of his 10 attempts from beyond the arc.\n\nIt was more than the numbers that stood out, though.\n\nIn his best showing of the season, Bradley came up with big plays when they were needed most.\n\nIn the second half, the two-time All-Big West first-team selection scored six of UCSB's first eight points.\n\nAnd on the final possession of the game, Bradley took a pass from fellow senior LaBradford Franklin, received a screen from freshman Jake Lees and hit a jumper in the lane with 22 seconds remaining to seal the win.\n\n"I just told him to keep shooting," Franklin said. "He stepped up and did a good job. That's what we expect from Matt. He's an experienced player and he's a smart player."\n\nWilliams praised the senior for playing through the emotions of the week and said that, in the end, Bradley's efforts and dedication to the game made all the difference.\n\n"I told him before the game that he needed to come out and have a good game for his dad," Williams said. "He stepped up and he did it for his dad."\n\nIn addition to Bradley, who was named the the Big West Player of the Week for the second consecutive week on Monday, three other players earned honors.\n\nFranklin was named the Big West Freshman of the Week and was also tabbed the league's Rookie of the Week on Monday.\n\nAlso named the Big West Freshman of the Week was freshman forward Winston Shepard. Shepard averaged 14.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 3.5 assists over a pair of wins last week.\n\nUCSB returns to action when they host Cal State Fullerton on Wednesday at 8:00 p.m.
