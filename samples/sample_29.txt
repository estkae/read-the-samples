\n\nHi~ B een a long time no see. Thank you for the continued support on the blog. So, how have you all been doing?\n\nToday, I have a special post. I know most of you do not know but it is the 'World Animal Day'. The day is celebrated worldwide on October 4 to create awareness of animal rights and welfare. The day is a very special one for me because I am a vegetarian, animal lover and a dog-person.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo for the last one year, I have been trying to spread the awareness among the people. I have been trying to encourage people to stop using animals as fur coats, cosmetics and for food. I want people to know the feelings of these animals, the pains they suffer and what they go through while they are alive. Also, the environmental damage they cause to the planet. It is very important to spread this message because animals are treated as if they are some sort of toys that we can play with.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, I would like to share with you some tips on how we can help the animals and make the planet a better place to live. I also have a small personal pledge to make. Also, if you have not signed the pledge yet, you can also make your own pledge to protect the animals and the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips and pledges to help the animals\n\n(made by my friend!)\n\nOne way we can make a change is by making an effort to not use cosmetics that are tested on animals. We can choose to use all cruelty free products and make a conscious effort not to use anything that has been tested on animals.\n\nWays to reduce our carbon footprints and help protect the environment:\n\nAvoid eating meat, or even better, go vegetarian (dairy, eggs are not vegan but I still encourage you to stop using dairy products as well)\n\nUse eco-friendly products - Not just cosmetics but also in our everyday lives.\n\nGo cruelty free - Choose cruelty free products and wear clothes that have not been made out of leather, fur or wool.\n\nStop buying those animals that we do not need. Also, choose to buy second hand or recycled clothes. Avoid buying pets if you cannot provide the proper care for them.\n\nAdopt, don't buy! You can adopt a dog or cat from an animal shelter. Do not buy animals from pet stores or breeders. They are sold to you as "breed-free" animals but most of them have been bred in horrible conditions. Also, make sure you know the sex of the animal you are getting, because they usually are sold as 'un-neutered' or 'un-spayed' animals.\n\nMake a conscious effort to not use plastic bags. Use reusable bags or better still, try to avoid using bags at all.\n\nTry to use products that do not harm the environment and are biodegradable.\n\nWays to help the animals:\n\nSign the pledge - To show that you support the cause to protect the animals.\n\nShare the post - Let others know of the cruelty that the animals go through. Let them know how they can help the animals too.\n\nJoin or start a protest or campaign to help the animals.\n\nThe small pledge I am making is to help the animals. Every month, I will be donating some money to an animal shelter in my town to help feed the dogs and cats there.\n\nThese are just some of the ways we can help the animals and the planet. We can all make a change, and make this planet a better place to live.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to know how to become a vegan, and which cosmetics are tested on animals, you can read this post: How to be a vegan?\n\nRemember, we are what we eat, so be what you want to be. Be a good person, who loves animals and helps to save the planet.\n\nWith lots of love,\n\nPriya
