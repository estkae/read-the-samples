Perhaps best known for their exploits during the First World War and the Gallipoli campaign in particular, the ANZACs, or Anzacs, are the legendary members of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps.\n\nTheir contribution to the military campaign in the Middle East, including the battle at Gallipoli in 1915, will be recognised this year, with the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign being commemorated by the nations involved.\n\nThe events of the Gallipoli campaign resulted in heavy casualties, with a staggering 258,000 deaths and an additional 156,000 injuries for the Allied forces, including 44,000 British deaths and 29,000 French deaths.\n\nThe staggering casualty figures have subsequently been seized upon by those who question the strategic worth of the campaign.\n\nOne figure, British historian Niall Ferguson, wrote that “the Dardanelles fiasco was one of the greatest military blunders of all time, a story of incompetence, vanity and wishful thinking out of which could have been constructed a textbook case of how not to run a war”.\n\nSo why were the Gallipoli campaign and the actions of the ANZACs so significant for Australia and New Zealand, and what did the battle mean for the two countries?\n\nArrival of the ANZACs\n\nFollowing the outbreak of war in 1914, the Australian and New Zealand forces began arriving in Egypt. On February 25 1915 the first ANZAC troops arrived at Gallipoli, a total of 11,000. The rest of the 20,000 strong force arrived over the following weeks.\n\nMany of the ANZAC troops had volunteered at the outbreak of war, lured by the romantic and patriotic view of warfare and by a yearning for adventure.\n\nJust as the troops were largely made up of volunteers, the casualties at Gallipoli were also predominantly made up of volunteers.\n\nIt has been estimated that 10 percent of all the Australian and New Zealand troops at Gallipoli were killed during the campaign.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies commented that “the experience of war for Australians would always be Gallipoli”.\n\nPrior to the arrival of the ANZAC troops, the British had launched an attack on the Gallipoli peninsula on the 25th of April 1915.\n\nThe Allied attack consisted of five divisions, with most of the troops coming from the British Army. It was hoped that the landings would help the British Navy to get through the Dardanelles, a narrow strip of water separating the Aegean Sea and the Sea of Marmara, which leads to the Bosphorus and the Black Sea.\n\nHowever, the initial landings met with great opposition from the Turkish defenders, and the Allied forces soon became pinned down on the beaches and unable to advance.\n\nThe ANZAC troops arrived at Gallipoli, the capital of the Ottoman Empire’s European territories, just over a month later on the 19th of May 1915.\n\nThe ANZACs had initially been part of the British and French force in Egypt. They were moved to a separate command under General Ian Hamilton, with Australian General William Birdwood as his deputy.\n\nA General Order issued on the 3rd of May stated that the Australian and New Zealand troops were to be given “separate and distinct” duties from those of the British.\n\nThis was not intended to be interpreted as any form of segregation. Rather, it was due to the fact that the Australians and New Zealanders, despite being part of the British Empire, were soldiers who had volunteered from their own country, and who had formed a unique sense of national identity and pride.\n\nIn order to maintain a clear distinction between the Allied forces and the enemy, the ANZACs also adopted their own distinctive insignia, such as a yellow or red poppy on their badges and hats.\n\nHowever, despite the greater efforts to set the ANZACs apart from their Allied allies, the treatment of the soldiers at Gallipoli was the same as that received by the British.\n\nThe ANZACs were given responsibility for the defence of the Anzac Cove, at the northernmost tip of the Gallipoli Peninsula.\n\nThe cove was strategically important to the Turks because of its proximity to the Narrows, the strip of water which separated the peninsula from the Dardanelles.\n\nThe Anzacs were also expected to hold on to the various hills and ridges along the peninsula, despite the fact that the Allied positions were in constant danger of being shelled"
