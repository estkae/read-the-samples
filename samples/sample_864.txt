Tom Cruise is no stranger to acting stunts. In one of his most iconic roles, Top Gun, Cruise actually flew jets in real-life. For his new movie Jack Reacher, however, he had to leave his stunt man behind.\n\nWith director Christopher McQuarrie at the helm, Jack Reacher looks to be a hard-hitting action thriller that promises to give Cruise's daredevil side some free reign. One of the most dangerous scenes in the film? The moment Cruise's character runs into a car traveling at 50 mph.\n\nWith the help of stuntman Tim Rigby, Cruise made the risky move a reality. The actor explains that the car wasn't able to stop due to the speed at which it was traveling, so he had to make his run-in count. In order to do this, he had to use a technique that he learned in a training session with Rigby.\n\n“I had to have a good run at it and come in low,” Cruise explained, “so that I was going to make it. I’d only have a second to hit my mark.”\n\nNot only did the star have to remember his own part in the stunt, but he also had to make sure to block Rigby from the camera. To see just how tough it was to make the scene work, check out the video above.\n\nJack Reacher hits theaters Dec. 21.\n\nTell us what you think of Cruise's stunt work in the comments section below or tweet us @THR.\n\nTwitter: @AmandaLeeCook\n\nEmail: [email protected]
