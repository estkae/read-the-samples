They play in blue and white vertically striped shirts, black shorts and socks. Their best performance in the League Cup came in the 1987–88 season when they reached the quarter-finals.\n\nThe club's main rivals are Morecambe, where their match is known as the West Cumbrian derby, and Barrow, against whom they contest the Barrow-Carlisle derby.

This is the club's second relegation in successive seasons and the fourth time they have been relegated from the Football League.\n\nThe club was formed on 17 May 1904 at Shaddongate United's annual general meeting where the club's members voted to change the team's name to Carlisle United. All words and titles were retained with the exception of 'United', which was shortened to 'Carlisle'. Carlisle United's first game was a friendly match on 5 September 1904 at home against Hull City which ended in a 2–2 draw. The first competitive game was an FA Cup preliminary round replay against York City, which ended 3–0 in favour of Carlisle.\n\nThis first season saw Carlisle play friendlies against Millwall, Sheffield United and Manchester United. In 1905, Carlisle United won their first trophy, the West Cumbria League and the Carlisle Border League, and were crowned champions of the West Cumbria League for the second consecutive season. They finished as runners-up in the West Cumbria League and moved on to the Carlisle & District League which they won in the 1907–08 season. They won the Border League and the Carlisle & District League in the 1908–09 season, before going on to win the West Cumbria League again in the 1909–10 season.

Carlisle achieved their highest position in the English football league pyramid when they came eighth in the 1950–51 season. In the 1953–54 season, Carlisle played in one of the first floodlit friendlies, against Everton.\n\nThe club was nicknamed "The Reds" in the 1960s due to the colour of their kit and their fans' similar devotion. Carlisle's greatest achievement in cup competitions until recent times was in reaching the semi-finals of the 1964–65 FA Cup.
