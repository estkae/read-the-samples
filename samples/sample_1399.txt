If you don't do any shooting in low light, there's nothing this camera can do that the 5DmkII can't do just as well or better.\n\n\n\nIt seems to me that the video feature was primarily introduced to help sell the camera in Asian markets where people are using it as a primary camera, and it gives the 5D2 a much-needed leg up in that market. But in the west, it's been largely ignored by users of the 5DII, and I think it's likely to continue that way.\n\n\n\nThere are many reasons I think this. First and foremost, the Canon DSLRs that were meant to replace the 5DmkII are the 7D and 60D. Both of these cameras are superb cameras for video, and even more affordable than the 5D2. As such, I don't see why anyone would buy a 5D2 unless they just wanted a full-frame camera and didn't want to spend more for the 7D or 60D.\n\n\n\nSecondly, the 5D2's video mode doesn't offer a lot of advantages over its predecessors that justify paying the extra price of a 5D2. The only two things I can think of are the dual DIGIC IV processors, which don't really have much of an impact in video mode, and the noise reduction in video mode, which is a good thing but probably not enough to make most people spend the extra cash on a 5D2 for.\n\n\n\nThirdly, the camera has major draw backs that don't exist on the 7D or 60D. One is the time it takes to turn on the camera and start recording. The other is that it uses a much slower frame rate than the 7D and 60D, and only allows it to record a maximum of 29 minutes of video on one card. The 60D allows recording for an hour and a half on a 16GB card.\n\n\n\nThose reasons combined with the fact that the 5D2's video mode doesn't do anything that a 7D or 60D can't do just as well or better, I think that it's going to get used very little, and people will be buying these primarily as still cameras and occasional video cameras.
