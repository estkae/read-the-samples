It was a targeted theft.\n\n“We are keen to hear from anyone who has any information about this incident, or who has been offered a similar vehicle for sale.\n\n“We are particularly keen to hear from anyone who saw the vehicle between 9.30pm and 10pm on Monday night.”\n\nThe theft of Fletcher’s Bentley follows the theft of Sunderland’s team bus in 2008.\n\nThe club’s coach was stolen from outside the Stadium of Light on the evening of the final game of the season against Fulham.\n\nA club spokesman said at the time: “We’re concerned and disappointed that someone could stoop so low as to steal the team bus and all of the club’s transport plans.\n\n“This is an act that should shame football fans.\n\n“We would appeal to whoever stole the bus to think again and drop it back to us.”\n\nAnyone with information is asked to contact Northumbria Police on 101 ext 69191.
