Chicago Cubs' Ben Zobrist, center, and Jason Heyward celebrate their 6-4 win over the New York Mets in Game 5 of the National League baseball championship series, in Chicago.\n\nThe Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland Indians will play Game 1 of the World Series on Tuesday night.\n\nAfter a century-plus of bad luck and heartbreak, the Cubbies are finally returning to the World Series. Here's what you need to know about their opponent.\n\nWho is Cleveland's best pitcher?\n\nThe Tribe's biggest strength is starting pitching, especially the top three.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCleveland’s No. 1 starter, a workhorse named Corey Kluber, has been nearly unhittable this season. He won 18 games, with an American League-best 268 strikeouts. He was a Cy Young Award finalist.\n\nCleveland’s other two starters, Trevor Bauer and Josh Tomlin, are not far behind. Bauer was a rookie this season but made 30 starts.\n\nThe pitching staff is deep, with only two pitchers with more than 50 appearances. In other words, manager Terry Francona can stay with his rotation and not go to the bullpen until he needs to.\n\nWhat about the hitters?\n\nThe Indians are not a typical powerhouse.\n\nNo player hit more than 18 home runs this season. Only three players reached double digits.\n\nWhat the Indians have is a lineup that is well-balanced and a group of sluggers at the bottom of the order.\n\nOne of the big reasons for Cleveland’s success this season was a revamped lineup. They added free-agent outfielder Rajai Davis, who brought speed and timely hitting.\n\nIt will be up to the top of the order to set the table. With Francona’s strategy, though, he can make substitutions if a certain batter is struggling.\n\nWhat's at stake?\n\nWhile Chicago is celebrating its first trip to the World Series since 1945, Cleveland fans are celebrating their first since 1997.\n\nAs of Sunday, the average asking price for a ticket was $2,517.41. The most expensive ticket was going for $7,690.\n\nWhile Cubs fans will be watching the World Series for the first time since 1945, it's a more familiar scene for Tribe fans, who are watching for the first time since 1997.\n\nA victory on Wednesday would mean more than a championship for the city of Cleveland.\n\nThe city has gone through several years of hard times after the steel industry fell. Cleveland was the poster child for the national decline of manufacturing.\n\nBut a victory would help the city lift its spirits and bring more stability to a community still on the mend.
