GRIDCOIN\n\nTicker: GRC\n\nStart Date: 2014\n\nInitial Price: 0.03 EUR\n\nSupply: (See https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gridcoin/)\n\nGRIDCOIN is the first cryptocurrency designed to work with the Internet of Things. The code was peer reviewed by cryptographers and distributed system theorists to analyze its security and design. It is built on the Cryptonight algorithm, which is designed to resist specialized mining hardware and make mining both memory and GPU friendly.\n\nCryptonight is resistant to:\n\nMemory hardness\n\nHigh memory demands\n\nASIC and FPGA resistance\n\nGPU-friendly\n\nCryptonight is the first algorithm to successfully combine all of these features.\n\nREWARDS DISTRIBUTION\n\nGridcoin uses a dual-blockchain system to verify transactions and create coins. The “proof-of-research” algorithm for creating coins requires work from the miners, to increase security.\n\nThe supply is split 50-50 between coins distributed via Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and coins distributed via Proof-of-Research (PoR). The more you contribute to the BOINC network, the larger your share of the PoR supply.\n\nProof-of-Research (PoR)\n\nProof-of-Research, or “Proof-of-Research” is a new, unique algorithm to distribute Gridcoin. The Gridcoin Proof-of-Research algorithm can be summarized as follows:\n\nCryptographic verification of work - The work being submitted has been verified via multiple cryptographic algorithms and is sufficiently difficult.\n\nShare work with BOINC network - The work being submitted is work that has been sent to the BOINC network to be processed.\n\nNetwork weight - The network weight is a continually updated figure that gauges the amount of processing power that the network is contributing to the project.\n\nRecent average credit - This is a metric that is the average amount of BOINC credits that the project you are contributing work to has received recently.\n\nRecent average credit weighs more heavily than network weight in Proof-of-Research. This means that if the project you are contributing work to is having a bad day and not processing as many tasks as usual, you will be less likely to receive research credit than if the network weight was the only determining factor.\n\nBOINC PROJECTS\n\nBOINC is an open-source volunteer oriented distributed computing grid which combines the processing power of all individual users for the purposes of scientific research. It’s free, and harnesses the unused clock cycles from processors and graphics cards to attempt to cure cancer/aids/ebola/malaria, map the milkyway, crack enigma codes, etc..\n\nBOINC user accounts can be viewed on the BOINC web site (https://www.bioinc.ca/en/).\n\nBOINC statistics can be viewed on the BOINCStats web site (http://boincstats.com/en/stats_help.php).\n\nThere are numerous BOINC projects that currently require more processing power than they have available, and so BOINC users may choose to contribute their excess CPU/GPU cycles to any of the currently running projects.
