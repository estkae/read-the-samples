November 11th, 2012\n\nWhile we’re waiting for the official Apple iPod nano 2G Review to come, I wanted to share my review and give you my thoughts. I’ve now had the second generation of the iPod nano for about a week and wanted to give you my thoughts about it.\n\n(Last Updated: Nov 12th, 2012)\n\nThe Physical Design\n\nI think Apple got this design right with the nano. It’s very thin and light, which I like. It’s almost identical to the 1st gen nano, but thinner, and with a larger screen. The big deal for me is that it is so much thinner and smaller than the previous nano. I don’t know why I like that so much, but it does make it so much easier to carry around.\n\nThe Screen\n\nI was initially concerned about the small size of the screen. My fear was that I wouldn’t be able to see the screen as well, or that it would be harder to navigate the menus. I’m very happy to report that the screen size is perfect for what I want. I think the new screen is just large enough to easily navigate menus and change songs.\n\nThe Sound Quality\n\nI was very skeptical about the new sound quality. I don’t have a lot of time to listen to music, and when I do, I usually do it while at the gym. So for me, sound quality is not a huge priority, but I was concerned about it with the new nano.\n\nWell, I am very happy to say that the sound quality is much better than the first generation nano. It is not better than my 4th gen iPod touch, but it is about the same, and sounds really good to me.\n\nThe Battery Life\n\nThe battery life of the new nano is what I was most worried about. The previous nano only got about 5 hours of battery life when playing music, and this is the same battery as the first generation nano. But I was pleasantly surprised by the new nano. It only lasts about 8 hours, but that’s fine for me. My goal is to carry a nano that can give me 8 hours of listening time at the gym. The only time I need longer than that is when I’m traveling for work, and I have my iPhone with me for music.\n\nThe Software\n\nI’m not going to go into too much detail here, but I am very happy with the new software. I think the new interface looks great and I love that I can easily make the album art fit the screen perfectly.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, I’m very happy with the new iPod nano 2G. It is the perfect size and weight for me. It sounds good, and the battery life is good enough for me. It’s nice to have an iPod that’s small enough to fit in my pocket.\n\nI would definitely recommend the new iPod nano. If you already have a 1st gen nano, the only reason to upgrade is for the size.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind, is that Apple has said that"
