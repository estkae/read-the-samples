\n\nNew details from the continuing Vulture Central investigation into Mitt Romney's dog-handling abilities, gleaned from sources close to the candidate, suggest the presidential hopeful isn't afraid of taking it up to the hounds.\n\n\n\nThe future candidate took in a stray in New Hampshire a few weeks ago and the canine - nicknamed Subby - has been living in the backyard of the Romney household, where it keeps the garden and the children in line.\n\n\n\n"He had some pretty bad-ass looking teeth so I figured I'd better show him who's boss," Romney was heard telling one of his guests at a recent dinner party. "Don't want him to think he can get away with anything."\n\n\n\nWhen asked how he's training the beast, the candidate was coy: "Some guys are of the school that you should give a good talking to, a kick on the ass, or maybe a slap around the head a few times.\n\n\n\n"I just look at him and he quits barking. Works every time."\n\nIn case you missed it yesterday: Willard Mitten with some more attention-grabbing "information" about the lovable mongrel.Apparently, he found a puppy. And of course, he immediately put it in the White House.This is an example of being sure he can beat Barack Obama. He believes that his "elevated" and "God-like" status can get anyone to do anything he wants. (Even if he is a jerk about it.)It's no wonder the Republicans think he has a real chance to be President. For them, this is "business as usual".The rest of us know how this one ends.
