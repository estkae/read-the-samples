With 65 percent of public companies using some form of the enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, the stage has been set for growth of more focused ERP software as cloud-based applications become more popular, according to a new report from research firm IDC.\n\nThe new study, Enterprise Resource Planning Suites for Midsize Businesses: Market Trends and Vendor Analysis, noted that this has lead to more competition in the ERP market, where smaller ERP vendors are using cloud technology to provide new services.\n\n"The number of ERP vendors is growing. They're beginning to use cloud technology to build more focused suites," says Martha O'Brien, a senior research analyst at IDC. "Cloud enables companies to focus more on their core competencies."\n\nIn addition, O'Brien said that midsize companies are using a mix of on-premise and cloud software, while larger companies are almost exclusively using cloud solutions. She noted that the more mature the industry, the more companies tend to use cloud.\n\n"Midsize companies are open to different technologies, including cloud," she says.\n\nThe findings are in line with what the report found to be the most popular ERP suites in 2013.\n\nAccording to the IDC report, SAP continues to be the most widely used ERP suite. Its market share grew 8.1 percent from 2012, to 44 percent. Oracle's share grew 3.8 percent to 27.3 percent, while Microsoft's share fell 5.7 percent to 11.8 percent. Other vendors, such as Salesforce.com and NetSuite, together gained 4.7 percent of the market, reaching 17.2 percent.\n\nIn terms of purchasing decisions, midsize companies are concerned about cost, vendor selection, functional fit, and integration with existing systems. They also want to ensure that the software will support their future business needs.
