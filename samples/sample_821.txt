"Reflexology\n\nReflexology is a holistic modality that focuses on the feet. The hands of a reflexologist do not physically touch the feet of the client. Instead, a client is seated while the reflexologist is behind them and will apply deep pressure, pressure with the ball of the foot, or kneading to the feet and sometimes the legs.\n\nThe objective of reflexology is to restore the body to its natural state of well-being and balance by stimulating certain reflexes. This form of bodywork has its roots in ancient Egypt, India, China and Japan.\n\nReflexology is used in a variety of settings and is gaining in popularity as a complementary therapy for pain management and stress reduction. The action of pressing on reflex points on the feet can reduce tension and release muscle spasms.\n\nA trained reflexologist will be able to balance the energy throughout the entire body and encourage all areas of the body to work in harmony. Reflexology is a gentle and soothing therapy that can be used as an alternative to other more aggressive techniques or as a complementary therapy.
