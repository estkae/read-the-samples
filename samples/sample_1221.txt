I've found an interesting issue with the Dell XPS 15 (9570) that might be the cause for some early deceleration of the fans.\n\nWhen I use a mixed GPU configuration (NVIDIA GTX 1060 & Intel HD 630), the following behaviour occurs:\n\nCPU usage drops to <10% during GPU rendering\n\nThis triggers the temperature control to stop the fan\n\nAfter 15-30 minutes the CPU has warmed up\n\nThe fan starts again\n\nIs it possible that the CPU can have a negative effect on the fan control and therefore affect the deceleration of the fan?
