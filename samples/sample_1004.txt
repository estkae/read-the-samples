"India, home to the largest population of non-religious people in the world, has witnessed a sharp decline in religious diversity over the past century, a study has found. The study released on Tuesday by the US-based think-tank Pew Research Centre found that "the share of the non-religious in India's population is slated to rise to nearly 30% by 2050".\n\nThe report analysed demographic data and survey responses of nearly 1,000 people across 13 states and union territories in India, and concluded that almost 30% of Indians do not practice or identify with any religion.\n\nThe share of Hindus, the largest religious community in India, is expected to drop from 81.3% of the population in 2015 to 78.5% in 2050, the report said. It found that religious minorities — which include Muslims, Christians and Sikhs — will make up a greater share of India's population in the coming decades.\n\nIndia has the third-largest Muslim population in the world after Indonesia and Pakistan, but has a relatively low population of Christians.\n\nNon-religious people make up the largest share of India's population (28.7%), followed by Muslims (18.4%), Hindus (81.3%), Christians (2.3%) and Sikhs (1.7%).\n\nIn terms of percentage share of population, India is currently behind only three other countries — China, the Czech Republic and Japan — where non-religious people are the majority.\n\nHowever, India is expected to surpass the Czech Republic and China by 2050 to emerge as the country with the highest number of non-religious people in the world, the study said.\n\nAt 30%, India would have nearly as many non-religious people as the rest of the world put together (31%).\n\nGlobally, the proportion of non-religious people is expected to rise from 13% of the population to 16% over the next 35 years.\n\nThe researchers analysed census and survey data from 16 states and union territories where non-religious people are the second-largest religious group.\n\nThese states include Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe report is based on the assumption that fertility rates and religious conversion patterns will stay the same as they have been since 1991.\n\nFirst Published: Mar 06, 2018 14:42 IST
