It codified bigotry against gay Americans, and was an egregious and ridiculous expression of the government’s will to regulate and even punish the lives of gays, lesbians, and their families. Ad Policy\n\nBut it is gone now.\n\nThe Defense of Marriage Act was supposed to stop courts from applying the Constitution’s guarantees of equality to gay and lesbian couples. It was supposed to prevent the federal government from recognizing and respecting legal unions between same-sex couples.\n\nIt did not. It never could have.\n\nDennis Hollingsworth was the multimillionaire behind California’s Proposition 8, which undermined the state’s prior recognition of marriage equality. Hollingsworth also sought to block same-sex marriages through litigation and judicial activism. Hollingsworth and others like him have made it clear that they don’t believe gays and lesbians are entitled to any of the same rights that heterosexuals are. But they are wrong. The Defense of Marriage Act, with its antigay animus, was overturned today by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court affirmed that there is no state right, or rational basis, for discriminating against gays, lesbians, and their families. The Constitution is and must be applied to everyone equally.\n\nBecause of DOMA, the federal government was prohibited from recognizing the legal unions of gay and lesbian couples. It was supposed to be the perfect tool for gays and lesbians to never achieve equality.\n\nBut it was not.\n\nWhen gays and lesbians challenged the Defense of Marriage Act, and argued that the law and its enforcement violated their rights under the Constitution, they prevailed.\n\nThe case that brought down the Defense of Marriage Act was United States v. Windsor, and Edie Windsor prevailed, despite the best efforts of some very retrograde forces, including House Speaker John Boehner, who used Congress to defend DOMA and the bigotry of the past.\n\nThe Supreme Court issued a strong, clear ruling that the Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional. And it also said DOMA was unconstitutional because of its animus toward gay people.\n\n“It is proper to hold that, at a minimum, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that the right to marry, or the substantial equivalent thereof, be afforded to same-sex couples,” wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy. “DOMA, as applied to same-sex couples legally married under the laws of their State, violates the Equal Protection Clause because it does not serve a legitimate governmental purpose.”\n\nAnd Kennedy concluded:\n\nDOMA, as applied to legally married same-sex couples, violates equal protection and is therefore unconstitutional. The Court’s disposition of this case makes clear that the Constitution’s guarantee of equality is “forceful” and “cannot be denied.” The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nWhen gay and lesbian couples sought federal benefits for their families, they met resistance, and in some cases hostility. For example, if a same-sex couple was married in New York, that couple would receive benefits. But if the couple traveled to Maryland, they would be treated as unmarried, even if they were legally married. There was no basis for treating same-sex couples differently. And yet, the Defense of Marriage Act codified that discrimination.\n\nThe Court recognized that. It held that DOMA violated the Constitution because it was passed with animus toward gay people, and because there was no legitimate justification for the law’s discriminatory purpose. The Court did not simply overturn the Defense of Marriage Act because it decided that it did not like the law. The Court actually agreed that the law was flawed. It agreed that it should not be the law.\n\nDennis Hollingsworth is gone. DOMA is gone.\n\nAnd there is a lot of work to be done to extend the Constitution’s guarantees to gays, lesbians, and their families. But this is a very big step forward.\n\nRead the Court’s decision here.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Supreme Court has been called the best reality show in town.\n\nWell, for one day, at least, the show’s producers decided to produce an episode that would bring people together, and help forge alliances between liberals, progressives, libertarians, and conservatives.\n\nIt was a good day to watch the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Court has decided to hear several marriage equality cases this term. There are petitions from California, which already allows for same-sex marriage, and Utah, which does not, and a petition from New York, where gay and lesbian couples have been allowed to marry for several years. The Court also will hear a challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act.\n\nIn other words, the Court has agreed to hear the two most important cases involving marriage equality this term.\n\nThe cases raise issues of"
