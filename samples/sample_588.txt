Abstract\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nThe effect of residual carboxylic acids (RCA) on the color formation of catechin/TEMPO-O/hydrogen peroxide (HTP) radical cation (RCAT) systems was studied in the presence of NaF, Na, or NaOH. It was found that addition of RCA in TEMPO-O/HTP systems greatly affected the color change of the color reagent (CRC) to orange-brown, and the color intensity varied with the concentration of Na. Increasing the concentration of RCA in the system was found to affect the nature of the color change; whereas, when RCA was present at low concentration (0.01 mmol/L), it induced the color to change from orange-brown to pink-red at pH 2.5, but caused a second change in color from pink-red to dark brown-black at pH 9.5. In contrast, when RCA was present at high concentration (0.1 mmol/L), it induced the color change from orange-brown to dark brown-black at pH 2.5, and from orange-brown to red at pH 9.5. It was also found that RCA increased the rate of TEMPO reduction in the absence of HTP, and the redox peaks at +0.53 V and +0.25 V could be observed in the 1H NMR spectra of the RCAT system. The ability of RCA to function as a redox mediator for HTP reduction is important in controlling the color of the CRC system, and can be used as a promising approach to develop novel colorimetric assay systems.
