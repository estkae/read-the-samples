BARRETT CITY MAN SENTENCED TO 42 YEARS FOR SEXUALLY ASSAULTING BOY\n\nA Barre City man was sentenced to 42 years in prison after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting a 10-year-old boy in the fall of 2012.\n\nWilliam Fogg, 59, of 79 Florence Road, pleaded guilty to aggravated sexual assault of a child on Thursday, Feb. 27, in Washington County criminal court. He was sentenced to 42 years, suspended after 32 years, and 10 years of probation. He was ordered to pay $1,000 in court costs.\n\nAccording to an affidavit by Vermont State Police Detective Daniel Walker, the assault occurred in Barre City in October 2012. The child told police the assault had happened in Fogg’s residence.\n\nFogg told police in an interview that the boy had been staying with him, but denied any sexual contact had taken place. Police conducted a search of Fogg’s residence and found no evidence of child pornography.\n\nJudge Thomas Zonay said he had seen the “black and white” of the crime and knew the difficult road the victim was going to have to travel.\n\n“You have caused great harm to a 10-year-old child,” Zonay said. “If there was ever a predator, it is you.”\n\nFogg was sentenced under the state’s Three Strikes Law.\n\nAt Fogg’s request, his attorney Robert Katims made a request for a reduced sentence on Fogg’s behalf, saying that Fogg had entered into a “long term” treatment program for sex offenders.\n\n“He’s not a threat to anyone now or in the future,” Katims said.\n\nAccording to police, Fogg is a Level 3 sex offender. The defendant told the court he had been working for the same employer for 20 years, and that he and his employer had offered to have the boy come and work with Fogg.\n\nFogg also told the court that he and the victim had made contact again after the assault, and had reconciled. He said that he had stayed in contact with the victim because he thought the boy’s father would have been hurt by their friendship ending.\n\nAccording to court papers, Fogg had served prison time in Vermont for sexual assault of a child and sexual assault on a person incapable of consent.\n\nThe victim told police he wanted to speak at the sentencing hearing, but was too nervous to do so.\n\nThe boy’s mother said she felt terrible about how the family was going to deal with this situation.\n\nShe asked the court for a reduced sentence for Fogg.\n\n“I’m asking for a second chance,” she said.\n\nWashington County State’s Attorney Scott Williams said he agreed that Fogg had been in treatment, but that this crime happened over a period of time, and he was worried that Fogg had a “sexual relationship” with the victim.\n\nWashington County Judge Thomas Zonay imposed the sentence.\n\n“This is a horrible offense,” Zonay said. “I hope you are a better person when you are released.”
