To all my dear friends at Creative Loafing,\n\nI regret to inform you that I'm leaving the paper to pursue other interests. This was a very difficult decision to make, but after careful consideration, I have decided that my future lies in freelance work.\n\nIt was a pleasure to work with the Creative Loafing team. I have grown as a reporter and learned a lot from the other reporters and editors, and I'll always cherish my time with the paper.\n\nAs for my future, I'm leaving CL to pursue freelance work. That is not to say that I'll never come back to CL, as I'm sure I will. But I just want to try working for myself for a while, to see what I can do as a freelancer.\n\nI will definitely still be writing, as I will be writing for National Geographic on freelance. As well as others, I will also be writing for other print publications.\n\nI just want to thank everyone for making my time with Creative Loafing a great one, and I want to wish you all the best in the future.\n\nSo long,\n\nJacob Kring-Schreifels
