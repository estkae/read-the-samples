July 13, 2015\n\nNot so great...\n\nI have this straightener and while it is a nice colour, and heats up fairly quickly, it is not really worth the price. It straightens okay, but not much better than cheaper ones, and it is quite heavy so it feels like it is burning your hair when you use it, which makes it really unpleasant to use. Also, I found it did not stay very straight the day after straightening, so I ended up having to straighten my hair every day instead of twice a week. Overall, I would not recommend this straightener.
