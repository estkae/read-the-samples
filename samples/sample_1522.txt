"4:04pm: Steve Adams has been sent down to Triple-A, while Heath Phillips has been called up, according to a club announcement.\n\n12:11pm: The Cubs have promoted left-handed reliever Justin Hancock to the big league roster, tweets Mark Gonzales of the Chicago Tribune. The corresponding move is unknown. Hancock takes the roster spot of right-hander Jake Arrieta, who was placed on the paternity leave list today.\n\nThe 27-year-old Hancock is a rather late bloomer, having signed with the Cubs as an undrafted free agent in 2010. He spent four years in the teamâ€™s minor league system, working his way up the ladder, before ultimately earning a call-up to the majors last year. Hancock posted a 1.17 ERA in 30 1/3 innings in his debut season, striking out 8.7 and walking 3.6 batters per nine innings. He has spent this season with the Triple-A Iowa Cubs, pitching to a 2.33 ERA with 8.3 K/9, 2.7 BB/9 and a 40.7 percent ground-ball rate in 38 innings.\n\nAs for the corresponding move to clear space on the roster, manager Joe Maddon suggested to reporters that it could be a swap of right-handers, meaning Brian Duensing or Justin Grimm could be headed to the 10-day DL. However, the Cubs could simply make a move to clear space for Hancock.
