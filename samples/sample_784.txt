While there are only two weeks to go before the U.S. presidential election, the outcome is very much in the balance.\n\nWith a difficult economic outlook ahead, the U.S. has a more than two-year spending plan to review and agree on.\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama is seeking re-election against former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who also challenged Obama for the White House in 2008.\n\nThe presidential race is coming down to the wire and a series of television debates. A Gallup poll, conducted on October 28, showed Obama holding a two percentage point lead over Romney.\n\nIf that translates to the polls, Obama would win by about two percentage points, not enough for him to win in the electoral college, and the outcome could depend on a handful of states in the key electoral college.\n\nIf Romney were to win by two percentage points, he would likely get the 270 electoral college votes required to be declared the winner.\n\nAn increasingly tough economic outlook and the fight over the fate of the health care law known as Obamacare are defining issues in the presidential race.\n\nObama came into office with an economy in free fall in 2009, but has seen the unemployment rate drop from 9.8 to 8.1 percent since he took office.\n\nRomney, meanwhile, has been pushing his experience as a former venture capitalist and his time as governor of a traditionally Democratic state as evidence of what he could do to create jobs as president.\n\nThe president was pushed to the center during his first term to tackle issues such as the budget deficit, tax reform, and immigration. But he is returning to the left-of-center platform of his first run for the White House in 2008, when he beat Senator John McCain of Arizona in the general election.\n\nThere are two television debates left before the November 6 election, one at the University of Denver and another in Florida.\n\nRecent presidential polls in swing states show Obama has an edge in Ohio, Virginia, Colorado and Iowa, but Romney is running close in Florida, Nevada and North Carolina.
