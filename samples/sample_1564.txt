Indo-European Lexicon\n\nPIE Etymon and IE Reflexes\n\nBelow we display: a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) etymon adapted from Pokorny, with our own English gloss; our Semantic Field assignment(s) for the etymon, linked to information about the field(s) ; an optional Comment; and Reflexes (derived words) in various Indo-European languages, organized by family/group in west-to-east order where Germanic is split into West/North/East families and English, our language of primary emphasis, is artificially separated from West Germanic. IE Reflexes appear most often as single words with any optional letter(s) enclosed in parentheses; but alternative full spellings are separated by '/' and "principal parts" appear in a standard order (e.g. masculine, feminine, and neuter forms) separated by commas.\n\nReflexes are annotated with: Part-of-Speech and/or other Grammatical feature(s) ; a short Gloss which, especially for modern English reflexes, may be confined to the oldest sense; and some Source citation(s) with 'LRC' always understood as editor. Keys to PoS/Gram feature abbreviations and Source codes appear below the reflexes; at the end are links to the previous/next etyma [in Pokorny's alphabetic order] that have reflexes.\n\nAll reflex pages are currently under active construction; as time goes on, corrections may be made and/or more etyma & reflexes may be added.\n\nPokorny Etymon: 2. ghrem-, ghr̥̄́m- 'to make wet, grow'\n\nSemantic Field(s): to Water, Wet\n\nIndo-European Reflexes:\n\nFamily/Language Reflex(es) PoS/Gram.
