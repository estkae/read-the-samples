BLACK SABBATH star Tony Iommi says that he has "no plans" to reunite with Ozzy Osbourne for another album or tour following the release of the group's new album, "13", in June (13).\n\nThe metal legends are about to launch their final world tour after performing in Latin America this month, but while fans can expect to see Osbourne and Geezer Butler at the shows, Iommi reveals that the band will not attempt to bring bassist Bill Ward back into the fold.\n\nHe tells Rolling Stone magazine, "There's no plans for another album or tour with (Ward). And the bottom line is that I wish him well, but I just can't go back. It's been too long. I just can't do it again."\n\nHe continues, "I'm not going to say that I'll never work with (Ward) again, but I'm not going to try to work with him again for the sake of the fans. It wouldn't be right. It wouldn't be fair."\n\nIommi also admits that he is baffled by the criticism Osbourne received for his behaviour during the band's Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame induction in April (13).\n\nHe says, "I know he's had problems over the years with drink and that, but I don't really know. All I know is what he did at the Hall Of Fame, which was absolutely incredible, because it was one of those rare moments when you see somebody and you know they're completely sober. It was really good."\n\nHe adds, "I really couldn't understand the criticism. But then again, I'm pretty thick-skinned about stuff like that. I can take it.\
