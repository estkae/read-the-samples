I'm guessing they think that the resistance from the iron is small compared to the drop in the lamp, and that is why they don't require you to use a watt meter to measure the lamp current.\n\n\n\nIt would be a good test to make and post the results on the blog so we can have a reference point.\n\n\n\nThe only problem I can see is that they assume it is 12.5V on the LED, but how do they know that?\n\n\n\nThe resistors would have to be a fairly small value to give enough current for the LED. But again the goal is to have a real value of light with a given voltage.
