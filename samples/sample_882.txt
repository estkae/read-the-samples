Harry's P.O.V\n\nI'm Harry Styles from One Direction!\n\nAt this moment in my life I'm happy. No one to disturb me. No paparazzi to follow me. No crazy fangirls to stalk me. No crazy girlfriends that make my life a living hell. My life's fine.\n\nI'm Harry Styles from One Direction!\n\nI go to school. I study. I have a girlfriend. That's about it.\n\nI'm Harry Styles from One Direction!\n\nThe teachers think I'm dumb because I don't study. The fangirls think I'm the most handsome boy ever. I don't care about them. All I care about is my girlfriend.\n\nI'm Harry Styles from One Direction!\n\nI need to go to the store and get some milk, and a few other things, I think.\n\nI get up and go to the fridge. I open the fridge door and grab the milk. I shut the fridge door and grab my keys. I go out the door and get in my car. I turn the key in the ignition and the engine starts. I drive to the store.\n\nI'm Harry Styles from One Direction!\n\nI park my car and get out. I get my keys ready to open the door. As I do that I see a girl.\n\nI look at her closer and see she has no shoelaces.\n\nMy heart drops a little as I recognize her.\n\nIt's my ex-girlfriend, Elisa.\n\nI look down at the keys and see my pocketknife in the little holder that was made for my keys.\n\nI'm Harry Styles from One Direction!\n\nI grab the pocketknife and open it. I reach my arm out and get ready to stab her in the heart.\n\nI'm Harry Styles from One Direction!\n\nI stab her in the chest with my knife and she falls to the ground dead.\n\nI'm Harry Styles from One Direction!\n\nI get back in"
