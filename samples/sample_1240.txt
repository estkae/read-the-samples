Writing a letter to the editor? Be sure to address your comments to the proper publication and editor. (Getty Images)\n\nApproximately 85 percent of adults read newspapers at least once a week, according to a Pew Research Center survey. A letter to the editor is one of the easiest ways to get your views out to a wide audience, but writing a good letter can be a challenge.\n\nKeep in mind that editors receive numerous letters each day, and a poorly written one can wind up in the trash. The best way to get your letter published is to get it right the first time.\n\nDecide on the newspaper and specific editor to whom you will submit your letter.\n\nWhen you are ready to write your letter, take time to think about your approach. Most letters are written to express opinions, respond to other published letters, or request an action by a government official or business. A typical newspaper runs fewer than five letters per day, according to a survey of about 150 daily newspapers conducted by the Newspaper Association of America.\n\nMake sure your letter includes enough relevant information.\n\nUse standard grammar and spelling.\n\nWrite a short, interesting letter, and avoid writing in a patronizing tone.\n\nAvoid anger.\n\nAddress a point with concrete examples rather than speculation.\n\nKeep the letter within a certain word limit, which varies by newspaper. (Most major newspapers limit letters to 250 words or less.)\n\nInclude your contact information, including your address and phone number. (If you include your e-mail address, make sure you use a pseudonym and a private account.)\n\nIf you are replying to a previous letter, be sure to include the date and the name of the writer you are replying to.\n\nIf you are requesting a particular action, be sure to include what you are asking for.\n\nFor example, instead of writing, “I think the mayor should resign,” write, “I think Mayor Smith should resign.”\n\nSign your letter with your first and last name, rather than “a concerned citizen.”
