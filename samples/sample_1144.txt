ROME (Reuters) - Italy’s public debt will rise to a record of 2.3 trillion euros ($2.56 trillion) this year as the recession keeps pushing up borrowing, Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco said on Wednesday.\n\nThe Bank of Italy's headquarters are seen in downtown Rome, Italy, May 27, 2016. REUTERS/Tony Gentile\n\nItaly has posted 10 straight quarters of economic contraction and data on Wednesday showed its banks have been suffering record bad loans losses.\n\n“Given the public debt dynamics, the (debt to gross domestic product) ratio will keep increasing for the foreseeable future, rising to around 130 percent of GDP in 2020,” Visco told the Senate.\n\nPublic debt will rise to 2.3 trillion euros ($2.56 trillion) this year and to 2.4 trillion euros ($2.65 trillion) in 2017, according to the latest figures from the Bank of Italy.\n\nEconomy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan warned earlier this month that the government may have to revise its goal of balancing the budget by 2018 after slower than expected growth.\n\nItaly’s public debt is second only to that of Greece in the euro zone, and its annual borrowing requirements of around 100 billion euros are equivalent to about 2 percent of gross domestic product.\n\nPublic debt stood at around 2 trillion euros at the end of 2015, equal to 133 percent of GDP, the Bank of Italy said.
