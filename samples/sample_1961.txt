"Not so long ago, one would only see the “dirtiest” of the “dirty” stuff around this time of year. No longer!\n\nIn the old days, one would have to actually go into a store and find the games marked down to unappealing prices, as they usually were around this time of year. It would be common to see piles of unappealing PS2 games, unopened Nintendo DS games, even remakes of classics for Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo.\n\nNowadays, this is an every day occurrence, but what was really worth noting was that on December 15th and 16th, both Amazon and Walmart actually had two different systems being sold at deeply discounted prices.\n\nWalmart was selling a special collector’s edition of Halo 4 for $40. This was also a very popular game when it came out, so this was quite an impressive price. I’m a little bummed that I missed this deal, as I am a huge Halo fan.\n\nAmazon was selling the 2nd edition of the PlayStation 3 Super Slim for $185.00, or $80 off the original price. The reason why this was significant is that the 2nd edition of the PS3 had very little improvement over the original model, but a lot of people seemed to buy them anyway. It appears that Amazon is trying to clear them out before they announce the newest PlayStation 4 console, which will most likely be available for sale at Christmas.
