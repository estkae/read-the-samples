Some residents of the Villages of Leisure World will remember Frank Kaminski, who was our representative on the Community Management Association Board for many years.\n\nI had been thinking about Frank and his death, and I began to wonder how many of our current residents are aware of the fact that each year at this time, we observe Veterans Day. We also hold a parade and a ceremony in the Ardenwood district of the Community Center where those who have served our country, be it in military service or other forms of government service, can be recognized for their contributions. I believe that the overwhelming majority of our residents would appreciate having an observance of this important day.\n\nI learned that we had some veterans who were residents at the time, but they were few in number and the parade was not held that year. Perhaps the occasion had not been sufficiently advertised and a sufficient number of residents were not aware of the event.\n\nI donâ€™t know how many of our veterans have passed away in the past 10 years, but I would like to see some way in which we could honor them on this occasion. I know that residents of the Ardenwood area would be delighted to have this occur again. I encourage the current members of the Community Management Board to look into this matter. I have already contacted some of our residents who were interested in this subject when I was Board president.\n\nI have been thinking about Frank, a Navy veteran and a WWII survivor of the USS Lexington, who was a good friend and an outstanding member of the Board. He had such a sense of loyalty and patriotism and really loved the U.S. flag.\n\nIt is never too late to give thanks and to show our appreciation.\n\nSylvia K. Schubert\n\nArdenwood
