In fact, the hype behind the TUF finale pales in comparison to that of the rematch between Jones and Alexander Gustafsson at UFC 165.\n\nAnd yet, what we saw at UFC 165 was not much of a fight. It was one of the most one-sided bouts we've seen in the UFC in quite some time. It was so one-sided that you may wonder how anyone in their right mind would even consider this a rematch.\n\nThe great thing about the sport of MMA is that there's always room for redemption. If you have a bad fight, you can always fight again. It's the fight game and you're going to get beat. The question is whether you come back stronger than before, or if you let your confidence be shaken and spiral down into the abyss.\n\nWith that said, here are the five things we've learned from the first fight between Jon Jones and Alexander Gustafsson.\n\n1. Jon Jones is the King of the Light Heavyweights\n\nIt was never really in doubt, but Jones' domination at UFC 165 reminded the MMA world that he is the number one light heavyweight in the world.\n\nGustafsson had Jones in trouble in the first round, but since then, the champ hasn't even broken a sweat. He did it with an efficient takedown game and a brutal top game.\n\nGustafsson is the one fighter that seems to be able to at least hang with Jones, but he didn't come anywhere close to taking the champ out. He couldn't take him down and he couldn't even score a takedown of his own.\n\nThe main question now is whether Jones can deal with Alexander Gustafsson's size. Gustafsson is the tallest fighter Jones has ever faced, and if he can handle that length and that reach, he could very well be unstoppable.\n\n2. Jones doesn't respect Gustafsson\n\nThe one thing you want to see from a champion is that he takes the guy he's fighting seriously. He has to, because the moment he takes his opponent for granted, the guy could end up shocking him.\n\nUnfortunately, that wasn't the case at UFC 165. The entire fight, Jones fought as if he was just doing enough to win. He didn't even bother to engage in a little trash talk. And his disrespectful attitude afterward was more of the same.\n\nI get that he's the champ and he's not going to go overboard and lose his cool, but he should at least act like his opponent is dangerous and is not just a stepping stone for him.\n\nIf Gustafsson is ever going to get a rematch, he has to prove that he's the real deal. It will take a dominant win over the next opponent and a display of humility on his part, but a win over Glover Teixeira could be just what he needs.\n\n3. Size matters\n\nWhen it was announced that Jones and Gustafsson would have their rematch, most MMA fans were excited because we all knew it would be another great fight.\n\nWhat many of us did not expect, however, was how the fight would end up going. Most people expected a lot of striking between the two and to see who could best one another with the fewest amount of mistakes.\n\nThat is not what we got. Jones took Gustafsson down time and time again, and it was clear that the Swede was no match for the size of the champ.\n\nAlthough it's hard to say what would have happened if Gustafsson had been able to keep the fight standing, it's still not a very comforting thought to know that Gustafsson was outmatched by Jones in the grappling department.\n\n4. Jon Jones has some improvements to make\n\nThe first fight between Jones and Gustafsson was absolutely incredible and a lot of people would say that Jones was the clear-cut winner.\n\nI am not one of those people. Yes, Jones controlled the fight, but he wasn't as dominant as we all thought. Gustafsson had Jones in trouble in the first round and that is not something we see often with Jones.\n\nGustafsson has an incredible reach advantage, but that doesn't necessarily mean he will be able to hit Jones with his punches. After all, Gustafsson could not land a single significant punch and his best punch of the fight was a glancing blow.\n\nIf Gustafsson can hit Jones with his jab, he may have a chance, but he has to catch him first and that's a problem because Jones is incredibly fast. If he can put Jones on his back, however, he will most likely get the decision.\n\nIf there's one thing Jones has to work on, it's his takedown defense. It's not that he doesn't work on it because he does, but he needs to focus more on it.\n\n5. There are a lot of different ways to beat Jones\n\nI'm sure that most fans are excited for the possible rematch between Jones and Gustafsson, but even if Jones loses to Glover Teixeira, there are still a lot of options left for challengers.\n\nSome would say that Phil Davis could be a good opponent, but the reason that fight doesn't excite me is because Jones would simply take Davis down and it would be a one-sided beatdown.\n\nThen, there's Alexander Gustafsson, who I already mentioned and who has a good chance of beating Jones if he can figure out how to land his punches.\n\nAlthough that's a long shot, there are a few other fighters who could potentially beat Jones in the future. Antonio Rogerio Nogueira and Mauricio Rua are on the list as well as Glover Teixeira.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, it feels like the light heavyweight division has new life.\n\nThanks for reading, you can follow me on Twitter @RileyLittle.\n\nStay tuned right here at MMA Sucka for more live streams as well as videos highlighting the top fighters, commentators, coaches, promoters and other names in MMA and combat sports.
