World Boxing News\n\nFormer two-weight world champion Ricky Burns has confirmed he is going to return to the ring on September 15.\n\nThe 31 year-old will be seeking a shot at revenge against the man who first claimed his super-featherweight title before returning to Scotland and stopping him in his tracks.\n\nPaulus Moses has never looked back since with wins over former champ Robert Guerrero, Gamaliel Diaz and Michael Katsidis.\n\n‘Turbo’ has revealed he is ready to get back in the ring and wants to stake his claim to be the next man to challenge the winner of the IBF world featherweight clash between Lee Selby and Evgeny Gradovich.\n\nHe said: “I’m feeling really good now,” said Burns. “I’ve been training for the last month and I can’t wait for the next fight. I want to get back in the ring and get that world title back. I feel good.\n\n“I’ve done a bit of sparring and I’ve been working with my strength and conditioning coach, so I’m feeling strong and fresh. I’m getting my weight down slowly and doing a lot of sparring. I’m getting back to the Ricky Burns we all know and love.”\n\nIn his last fight, Burns was stopped inside a round by Vasyl Lomachenko. After the fight, the Scot announced he would quit the sport, but changed his mind after working on his defence and improving his confidence in the gym.\n\n“I’m glad to be back,” he continued. “I was feeling bad for a while. I had to step away and think things through, and take my time, but now I’m ready to fight again.\n\n“I’m looking forward to getting back in the ring, getting the weight down and then getting my chance to fight for another world title.\n\n“I’m going to be looking for a win and to impress. The good thing about boxing is that there are so many good fights to be made. I’m looking forward to getting in there with someone.\n\n“I know there’s a great fight with Lee Selby or Evgeny Gradovich to be made. I would love to be in a big fight like that at some point.”\n\nBoxing fans in Glasgow will see Burns back in action at The SSE Hydro on September 15.\n\nLeave A Comment\n\ncomments
