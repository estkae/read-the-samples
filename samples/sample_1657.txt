The Byzantine empire as presented in this series is based on a more realistic understanding of the medieval, but some of the characters do not reflect this, especially among the military, and some do not even have Greek or Slavic names. They may also be more modern than the rest of the series, but the names should all be correct. See more\n\nGoofs\n\nIn episode 2 of series 2 a pig's blood is used to soak some of the archers. However this practice was not in use until the 14th century, as this was the only way to stop the enemy from continuing to fire at them, and was not used until longbows became standard. In earlier warfare (late Roman and through the medieval period) the best way to defend from arrows was to have a shield and armour, or to crouch down. Thus it is unlikely that a battle with this many archers, who are able to kill most of the other characters (including one who could have helped the wounded) would resort to this in the 12th century, especially as arrows do not appear to be that hard to kill.
