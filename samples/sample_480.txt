This is the first time Iâ€™ve made this recipe and I absolutely loved it! It is now one of my favorites. It had a lot of flavor and the ginger and garlic added great zing. I used 1 tsp of ginger and 1/2 tsp of garlic. This was great served over brown rice. My husband raved about this meal. Thanks for a great recipe!\n\nI have made this for years but never reviewed it. The longer it sits the better it tastes. I do make it on a regular basis. I often do half coconut milk and half veggie broth. One of my family's favorite meals. I am thinking of using the coconut milk and broth when I cook it instead of water and bullion cube.
