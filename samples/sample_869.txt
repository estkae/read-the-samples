"Once you’ve got your SCOM environment setup, what do you do with it?\n\nThe next step is learning how to manage your environments using your new management system. There are a lot of options to learn, but you can get started with the basics fairly quickly and then move to advanced topics later. This blog is intended to introduce you to some of the basic tasks you can perform in SCOM once you have it up and running.\n\nFirst, you should know that there are three main nodes in the Operations Manager tree. The top node is the Management Group, the middle is the management server, and the bottom is the agent. We will focus on the top node and the bottom node.\n\nIn order to get started, the first thing you want to do is add one or more agent to your management group. I’ll focus on adding agents to the management group. When you get to a point where you are adding lots of agents, you can set up a group for those agents and add them as a group.\n\nTo add an agent, first select the root node, and then right click the Management Servers node. Select “Add Management Server”.\n\nThis will open the “Add Management Server” dialog. Select the agent you want to add.\n\nNow select the agent you want to add. This dialog allows you to define the monitoring root and specifies the details for the agent.\n\nThe next step is to add the management group to the console. Once you’ve added one or more management servers to the console, the next step is to add the management group. This is similar to adding the management servers, except you will be selecting the management group.\n\nThis will open the “Add Management Group” dialog. Select the group you want to add.\n\nOnce you’ve added the management group, you should be able to see the management servers and agent(s) within the management group. Now you’ve got the basics setup.\n\nNext, you’ll want to start monitoring something. Before you do anything, you should probably check out the default monitoring packs in Operations Manager. For SCOM 2007 there are two packs that are part of the default installation. They are Microsoft Monitoring Agent (64bit) and Microsoft Monitoring Agent (32bit). These packs are installed under the default management group.\n\nMonitoring a node, service or application with these packs is very easy. Select the node you want to monitor, and then select the Pack.\n\nIn this example, I selected a server and then the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (64bit) pack. This will bring up the Select and Monitor Wizard.\n\nOn the “Select the monitored resource” screen, select the computer you want to monitor. The wizard is pretty self explanatory. Click “Next”.\n\nThe wizard will display a list of available services, applications, processes, and other entities that can be monitored.\n\nSelect the items you want to monitor. In this case, I will monitor the process “explorer.exe” and the Service “BITS”. Click “Next”.\n\nThe last step is to review the information on the “Select Resources to Monitor” screen and then click “Next”.\n\nThe wizard will display the information about the monitors you’ve selected. Click “Next”.\n\nYou will now be taken to the “Select Management Packs to monitor” screen. Select the packs you want to use. In this case, I am going to select Microsoft Monitoring Agent (64bit) and Microsoft System Center Service Manager.\n\nOnce you’ve selected the appropriate management packs, click “Next”.\n\nThe next step is to select the default displays. There are a number of displays you can use to view the information that is gathered from the agent. You can view the data for the computer, the agents, and you can also view the inventory. The inventory allows you to view the computer hardware and software information.\n\nSelect the displays you want to use, and then click “Next”.\n\nThe wizard will display the information about the displays you’ve selected. Click “Next”.\n\nThe wizard will then list the monitors and displays that are associated with the management pack. Click “Next”.\n\nThe last step is to review the information on the “Select Monitors and Display” screen. Make sure the information is correct. If you’ve chosen to monitor the system state, you’ll also be asked to select the critical state you want to monitor. Once you’ve verified the information, click “Finish”.\n\nThe “Monitoring Wizard” will start and monitor the information you’ve selected. Click “Next”.\n\nIf you’ve selected the “Agent inventory” you’ll be able to view the hardware and software information. This information is useful when you are performing assessments on your systems. You can use this information to validate your environment.\n\nYou can also view the monitors for the agent. Click “View Monitor”.\n\nYou can drill down into the monitors and view the details about the monitored information. Click “View Data”.\n\nYou can also view the monitored items graphically.\n\nThese packs allow you to quickly and easily get a view of the status of the monitored entities. In the next part of this series, I will talk about creating your own monitoring packs and will include examples.
