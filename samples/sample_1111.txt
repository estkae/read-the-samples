"About half of consumers claim to have sent or received texts or email messages while driving, according to a survey released Monday.\n\nThe National Safety Council also found that more than one-third of drivers said they read text messages or email, sent them, or answered them while driving.\n\n“It’s distressing that a growing number of motorists are engaged in these potentially distracting activities while behind the wheel,” said Janet Froetscher, president and CEO of the National Safety Council. “However, the good news is that the majority are not, and we believe this is due to the educational efforts of groups like the NSC.”\n\nThe group said it conducted its survey in the third quarter of 2010 among 2,100 adults and found that 9 percent of respondents said they had sent a text message while driving and 14 percent said they had read one. Thirteen percent of drivers said they had sent email, and 19 percent said they had read an email.\n\nNearly one-third said they had answered a phone call or voicemail while driving.\n\nThe National Safety Council advocates for legislation to ban the use of mobile devices while driving. The group’s new survey comes as several states have considered such bills, including New York, which earlier this month passed a law barring drivers from texting and emailing.\n\nThe issue of texting while driving has also been the subject of a campaign by AT&T, the parent company of CNN.
