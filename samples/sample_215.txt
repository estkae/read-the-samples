A major renovation project at York University in Toronto is expected to run at least $26 million over budget, due to unanticipated problems that are forcing school officials to tear out and rebuild much of the work already completed.\n\nConstruction started in January 2014 on the $136-million project, which is meant to replace the York Arena, which opened in 1971, with a new, modernized facility with more seating and amenities.\n\nWork on the exterior of the arena was completed, but the contractor, Armel Holdings, noticed a problem when it came to the steel supports for the roof in June 2015, York University president Rhonda Lenton said.\n\n"We realized there were some structural concerns around the roof, so we paused the project," Lenton told CBC Toronto.\n\nSteel reinforcements will be needed to strengthen the roof, which was built with "soft" steel. (York University)\n\nWorkers discovered the roof of the arena had been built with "soft" steel, which is not as strong as the "hard" steel that is typically used for these types of projects, said Lenton.\n\nIn order to make sure the project is safe, crews need to rip out and rebuild about 50 per cent of the roof, at an estimated cost of $16 million.\n\n"We’ve got to take this roof down," said Lenton.\n\n"We will be replacing the steel — the beams — and re-engineering the entire roof structure, as well as all the supporting beams that support the roof."\n\nSchool officials say they will be applying for additional funding to cover the cost of the roof replacement.\n\n"We will be going to the province for the additional funding that we will need, for sure," Lenton said.\n\nThey are also hoping to get money from the York University Foundation, which is a non-profit fundraising organization that operates separately from the university, according to its website.\n\nShe said she does not believe taxpayers will have to foot the bill for the additional cost.\n\nUnforeseen problems\n\nYork University president Rhonda Lenton says she does not believe taxpayers will have to cover the $16-million cost of rebuilding the roof. (CBC)\n\nThe problems do not end with the roof.\n\n"We realized that there were some structural issues around the seating, and we’re replacing the seating, the wood seating in the arena," Lenton said.\n\nIn total, there will be 12 new levels added to the arena, along with a new heating and cooling system.\n\n"I think, because of the complexity of this building, we have to anticipate what other unforeseen problems may come along," Lenton said.\n\nIn December 2015, school officials sent a memo to university faculty and staff outlining the potential for "additional costs and associated risks" that could arise in the future.\n\n"We will continue to keep all our stakeholders updated as the project progresses and when we know more details about timing and scope of work," the memo said.\n\n"I’m just waiting for more details," said Brian Lee, a York University professor and co-chair of the university’s Local 79 union.\n\nLee said he thinks the university should have been more specific about the challenges facing the project.\n\n"There is no need for it to be kept secret," Lee said.\n\n"There’s nothing secretive about construction projects."\n\nScheduling setback\n\nThe timeline for the completion of the project has been extended by more than a year, said Lenton.\n\nThe university had initially planned to have the arena ready by the 2017-2018 school year, but that deadline has been pushed back to the 2018-2019 school year.\n\n"We did have an aggressive schedule. We have to replace a roof in a building that is up on a hill," Lenton said.\n\nLenton also said there will be more parking spaces at the arena once the project is complete. The university had to remove between 300 and 400 parking spaces in order to begin the work.\n\n"I think we will have more spaces than we had before," Lenton said.
