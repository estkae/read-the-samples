Kawanishi N1K\n\nThe Kawanishi N1K "Kyōfū" (強風, "Strong Wind") was a long-range single-seat carrier fighter aircraft, serving the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service during World War II. It was a single-engined, single-seat monoplane fighter designed to replace the A6M Zero, which was designed for shorter ranges.\n\nThe N1K was developed to replace the Nakajima A6M Zero in the long-range fighter role, and was the first fighter in the world to use the Type 3 "Hakuryū" 18-cylinder air-cooled radial engine, which was also used in the Kawanishi N1K1-J "Shiden" fighter. The Japanese Navy also gave it the name "Kyofu" (meaning "Strong Wind") as the manufacturer's symbol, the first time a name was given to a Japanese military aircraft.\n\nIn the end, only a handful of N1K1 fighters (armed with two 20 mm cannon and two 12.7 mm machine guns) were deployed operationally before the end of the war, and none ever engaged enemy aircraft in combat. After World War II, the Allied Occupation forces in Japan took possession of six N1K1 fighters and four N1K2 fighters. These aircraft were studied and flight tested by the Technical Air Intelligence Unit (TAIU) at Tachikawa. Test flights and subsequent analysis revealed that the N1K2 was the faster of the two types, but its lighter armament was deemed inadequate for combat, and the aircraft was regarded as lacking in manoeuvrability.\n\nFollowing the war, some of the N1K2 aircraft were provided to the USSR, and some were used by the "Taiwanese Air Force" (ROCAF), until all remaining aircraft were destroyed by a typhoon in 1950.\n\n\n\nThe only two remaining airworthy N1K2-J Shiden, on display in Japan, are preserved at the following museums:\n\nThe only remaining N1K1-J is on display at the Planes of Fame Air Museum in Chino, California. The airframe was recovered from the ocean in 1994 by Paul Allen and Don Arndt, restored to static display configuration and placed on display at the museum in 2003. The N1K1-J was removed from display in late 2013 for a full restoration, including flight testing, and returned to display on March 10, 2017.\n\nThe Soviet Union took possession of several of the N1K2-Ja variants and used them as the prototypes for the development of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15.\n\nTwo Shiden's survive in Taiwan. They are located in the Republic of China Air Force Museum in Taipei.\n\n\n
