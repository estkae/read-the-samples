The Reshaping of Geopolitics\n\nSUMMARY\n\n– China is the preeminent power in East Asia, with a formidable military, a deep national reserve of soft power, and a thriving and expanding economy.\n\n– Russia has a more modest military capacity than China, but compensates for this by being a strong player in the Middle East and by being much less constrained by rules and norms of international conduct.\n\n– India has a powerful economy and an ambitious diplomatic agenda. Despite a substantial military, India has suffered from a relative lack of geopolitical success.\n\n– Europe is the wealthiest part of the world but its strategic position is increasingly under question. It is seeking to reform its defense structures but remains relatively dependent on the United States for its security.\n\n– The Middle East is the center of the current geopolitical crisis. The region has been wracked by conflict, instability, and massive displacement of people. While it is at the center of the crisis, it is also at the center of great power ambitions.\n\n– Africa is being pulled in several different directions. The scramble for Africa is real. Countries like China and Russia are seeking influence on the continent, and the United States is trying to preserve its traditional role.\n\n– Latin America has largely escaped the impact of the current geopolitical crisis but this might not last for long.\n\n– Geopolitics is changing and becoming more complicated. One reason for this is the rise of new powers, like China and Russia. Another is the return of geopolitics after decades of neglect.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGeopolitics is the study of the distribution of power in the international system. The term "geopolitics" was first used in the early 19th century, by a Prussian student named Friedrich Ratzel. Ratzel saw geopolitics as a branch of political science, concerned with the power relationships between different countries. The study of geopolitics is based on a simple premise: Where power is located, there is political importance. This principle was not lost on the great European powers that competed for colonies and spheres of influence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the term "geopolitics" fell out of fashion, eclipsed by the term "international relations." But the fall of the Soviet Union led to a change in the international system. The United States emerged as the world's dominant power, a position that had a profound impact on the countries of the world. Some, like China, Russia, and Iran, sought to challenge the United States, while others, such as Mexico and Canada, largely acquiesced to the new reality. At the same time, globalization and the rise of the Internet created new economic and social opportunities. These new opportunities undermined the power of many of the world's countries. And they exposed the limits of the United States as the sole superpower, even as its strength grew relative to other countries.\n\nThe 21st century is reshaping the world. This report aims to understand the consequences of this change. It discusses the three main arenas in which geopolitical competition takes place. It also identifies the major powers in each region, and how they are likely to compete in the future.\n\n"Where power is located, there is political importance."\n\nTo understand geopolitics, it is useful to think of the world as divided into three main arenas.\n\nThe first is the traditional heartland of geopolitics: Europe and the Middle East.\n\nThe second is East Asia, which is the subject of the next report in this series.\n\nThe third is the Americas.\n\nWhat do these three regions have in common? Each is a geographic region that has historically been the center of great power politics. In each, a single dominant power has emerged. The Middle East, for instance, has been dominated by the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran. And both regions are being reshaped by the rise of new powers: China in East Asia, and the United States in the Middle East. Finally, in all three regions the nature of the state itself is under challenge, along with the primacy of geopolitics itself. The current global crisis has brought into question whether the prevailing order can survive in the 21st century.\n\nThis report begins with Europe and the Middle East because these regions are the oldest and most historically influential. We will also discuss the second geopolitical zone, East Asia. East Asia is growing in importance but is also the subject of the next report.\n\nThe report concludes with a discussion of the Americas. The United States is dominant in this region, but its primacy is being challenged by a more ambitious and powerful China. This rise has important implications for the geopolitics of the region.
