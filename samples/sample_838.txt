What's your favorite vegan resource for recipes and guidance?\n\nI also tried the crabless cakes. That didn't work.\n\n\n\nMy problem is when I do vegan I always fall back into my standard choices. Like pizza. And I don't even like pizza. So how about you? What are your staples? Or not?\n\n\n\nI know people love the Soy Curls thing, but I tried to cook them and the texture and taste reminded me of trying to cook cat food.\n\n\n\nI also tried the crabless cakes.
