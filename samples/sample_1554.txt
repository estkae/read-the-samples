AMD.\n\nAMD has just revealed its latest quarterly earnings report, and it's good news for the chipmaker, which has announced strong revenue gains and has seen a spike in its stock prices.\n\nAccording to the report, AMD has generated net revenue of $1.59 billion, a 23% jump over the same quarter last year. On a non-GAAP basis, AMD reported a profit of $158 million, up 74% over last year's quarter. AMD says it's on track to post another profitable quarter in the next three months.\n\nThe company credits its "new high-performance x86 and graphics processing units, new low-power APU platforms, and continued progress on [its] foundry business" as key factors for the impressive quarter.\n\nNot only is AMD beating its own expectations, but the company's stock is also soaring, rising 13.4% in after-hours trading.\n\nIn a press statement, AMD CEO Rory Read says that "the strategic investments we made in R&D and new product development with our ground-breaking Heterogeneous Systems Architecture are beginning to pay off."\n\nMatt Clark is a freelance writer covering the world of videogames, tech, and popular culture.
