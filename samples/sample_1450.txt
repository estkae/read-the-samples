The premium version of the HeliosÂ® 35 offers additional features in the areas of configuration and serviceability.\n\nIPv6 version\n\nIPv6 is supported in the premium versions, not in the standard version.\n\nThis implies that IPv6 addresses can be assigned to the VLAN interfaces and that communication with IPv6 nodes on the network is possible.\n\nCXML\n\nThe integrated web server supports CXML, the preferred XML language for VoIP gateways. This simplifies configuration of IP telephones, so that e.g. individual IP phones can be connected to the VoIP gateway individually.\n\nExpanded command line\n\nThe command line has been expanded, as has been the system log (syslog).\n\nIn addition, several of the interfaces have been adapted to the requirements of certain radio technologies and thus facilitate configuration of those interfaces.\n\nService functions and monitoring\n\nA unique feature of the premium versions is the integrated monitoring, using the RADWIN Manager.\n\nThe monitoring is available in the form of charts and tables, which can be used to extract meaningful information about the traffic load and quality of service (QoS).
