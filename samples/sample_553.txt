Critics said his comments would only increase people's anger at gardaí, and his remarks were even likened to the U-turn made by British prime minister Theresa May, when she apologised for the "hurt" caused by austerity measures.\n\nAddressing the Joint Policing Committee in Dublin yesterday, Mr Leahy said that in some cases, people complaining about the length of time it takes for gardaí to arrive at the scene of an emergency should look at the state they are in.\n\n"I think the point that I am making is that people look at the state of their clothing when they call the gardaí.\n\n"A lot of times, if you are wearing a suit and tie when you call, a car will be there.\n\n"When you call in a pair of pyjamas, it's a different story."\n\nHis comments were picked up by the Sunday Independent newspaper, which reported that Mr Leahy was taking an "unusual step" to appeal to the public to dress appropriately.\n\nThe assistant commissioner said it was "unfortunate" that members of the public would ring up and complain about the length of time it takes for gardaí to arrive.\n\n"A lot of times they are in pyjamas, and it is unfortunate," he said.\n\nThe government's austerity programme, which led to tax rises, welfare cuts and the privatisation of state assets, led to Mr May being branded a "U-turn queen" in 2016.\n\nAnd just last week, it was revealed that the NHS spent almost €500,000 sending patients on holidays last year.\n\nThe Department of Health said it spent €4,707,959 on hospital tourism last year, according to documents released under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nSunday Independent
