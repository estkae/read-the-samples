In fact, a lot of people who have been there say that China is much nicer.\n\n\n\nChina is not a poor country. They have tons of money and resources. Their problem is that they do not spend enough on infrastructure and don't value education as highly as they could. So their people do not make as much money as they could. And they don't have nice things. It is much nicer than India, but not as good as Japan. I would like to visit it, because I do not think I would be disappointed, but I don't expect it to be better than Japan.\n\n\n\nThey have a different mindset than us, and do things differently. Their government is not a democracy. It is a communist government. I think that is not a bad thing, and has it's benefits. They have much fewer guns and gun crime than we do. They are, for the most part, more honest than we are. Their infrastructure, while not as nice as ours, is very good. They spend more on infrastructure than we do. They have much more public transportation, and better public transportation. They are working on their environmental problems, and they have made more progress than we have. They have fewer social problems, and less crime than we do. They have a very good education system, especially compared to India.\n\n\n\nThey spend more money on schools and education, and invest more in their future, than we do.\n\n\n\nChina is a country that is far more well developed than many people in the US would think.\n\n\n\nThe fact that they have fewer guns, and better education and fewer social problems is probably why they have fewer school shootings than we do. I think we have way too many guns in this country, and that is a big part of the problem.\n\n\n\nJust my thoughts.
