It was only a matter of time before the cult of the ‘dad bod’ took the world by storm. The internet has been replete with articles, blog posts, and photos for the past few weeks, celebrating the ‘dad bod’ as the end-all-be-all of male physique. The dad bod is not an insult. It’s not an apology for your body. The dad bod is a celebration. It is a fun, refreshing movement that shows that men can enjoy their bodies at any size.\n\nForget about your 6-pack. Forget about your thigh gap. Your tummy is supposed to be flabby and your arms are supposed to jiggle when you run. It’s all in good fun. If you can let go of your obsession with perfection, you will find happiness in your natural body. It’s only then that you can start focusing on your life instead of your body.\n\nThe ‘dad bod’ is a bold statement that the new standard of male physique is one that embraces who you are and what you have. It’s a celebration of the soft, the jiggly, the flabby, the flaccid, and the unshaven. That’s what makes you unique. That’s what makes you human. It is about your character, personality, and soul. And it is about your spirit.\n\nLet’s take a look at what people are saying about the ‘dad bod’ movement:\n\n“You know, the dad bod? It’s kind of a big deal. It’s become a sort of cultural milestone, a touchstone for a certain kind of body acceptance. The dad bod says, “I go to the gym occasionally, but I also drink heavily on the weekends and enjoy eating eight slices of pizza at a time.” The dad bod says, “I’m a grown man, and my body tells the story of the life I’ve lived.” It’s not about having your cake and eating it too. It’s about living your life and loving your body.” — Max Joseph, Huffington Post “If you’re in shape, keep it up. If you’re not, it’s time to re-evaluate what’s really important. In reality, your life is probably more interesting than the guy who has been going to the gym for the last 5 years and has abs.” — Paul, The Dad Bod “I’m a dad. I’m not quite old enough to be a dad, but I am old enough to be a dad, and that’s how I look. It’s not that I’m a lazy person. It’s not that I don’t care about my appearance. I’m just not that concerned about it. The reality is I probably spend too much time on it.” — Sean, The Dad Bod “The current and future ‘bods’ should be proud that they have rejected the socially-dictated ideals of an unrealistic body type, and embraced the physical reality that they are, in fact, human.” — Justin Stenstrom, founder of Social Karma\n\nMen, it’s time to celebrate who you are. Let go of your obsession with the ‘perfect body’. There is no perfect body. Celebrate your own body, for it is as good as it can be. Rejoice!
