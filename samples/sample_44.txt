"The internet is a funny place, where people can get away with saying and doing the weirdest stuff that would otherwise be totally unacceptable.\n\nBut it turns out not even the internet is a free pass to sexually harass people.\n\nThat's what one woman learned when she was sent a totally inappropriate, NSFW photo from a stranger, that happened to be someone she knew in real life.\n\nTwitter user @kendtee, who describes herself as "an arm candy", tweeted about her encounter with the man she knew.\n\nAccording to @kendtee, the incident occurred after she agreed to take a picture with a guy. She then deleted the picture from her camera roll when it was over, and the man asked if she had. She said yes, and then he said this:\n\n"It's a shame we can't see the photo anymore because it was pretty good"\n\nShe didn't know how to respond. He then tweeted her back, asking her to "leave [the photo] up for a little while". She declined.\n\nApparently, he then texted her back, asking her to send him a copy of the picture.\n\nShocked by this behaviour, she shared the exchange on Twitter, and said the worst part was how "unbothered" he seemed about it.\n\nEventually she shared a screenshot of the exchange, and people were not impressed.\n\n"Oh wow. 'I'd do ya if I could' and then the photo request. You should probably just block him and be done with it. 'Doing ya' or not," one person said.\n\nAnother person had an idea on how to deal with it, tweeting, "You know what? Be a bigger person, send it to him. For posterity."\n\nMany others were in complete agreement with this sentiment.\n\n"I don't know this man and I probably never will. But I 100% understand why he's going to be blocked. A man who says that is definitely not a good person. All women should know their boundaries with men and this seems to me to be clear cut," one person said.\n\nIn the end, @kendtee went back to him and asked him to explain why he'd sent her that photo.\n\nAccording to @kendtee, he sent her this message in response:\n\n"How do you think I know that you're gonna see this tweet and block me or delete it.\n\n"I'm not trying to be a creep you just said that you'd do me so I figured we had a shot lol\n\n"I like your style and want to get to know you better\n\n"If you send the picture I promise not to be creepy and stop bothering you\n\n"I'm being serious here and I don't think I deserve the reaction I got\n\n"All I wanted to do was take a picture with a nice girl and see if she'd let me\n\n"I don't want to be a bad person or make you feel uncomfortable.\n\n"If you like I'll just go away\n\n"You're gorgeous and I'm sorry I don't deserve to meet you but I thought I'd try my luck\n\n"I won't message you again if you don't want me to\n\n"I'll delete the tweet and block you\n\n"I just wanted to try\n\n"Please"\n\nThe rest of Twitter wasn't impressed, calling him out for still not getting it, and for trying to shift the blame.\n\n"Like you have to explain what 'likes your style' means, like you're trying to shift the blame. But it's not ok. It's not ok for you to message someone for a photo. It's not ok for you to say 'I'd do you' and it's not ok for you to try and justify your actions," one person said.\n\nAnother pointed out that he was trying to pressure her into sending him the photo, and wasn't taking responsibility for his actions.\n\n"He's a creep, and still wants to force you to send him a picture of your body. He'll delete the tweet if you do, otherwise you can block him. This is on him, not you. You have no responsibility to 'meet' him," another person said.\n\n"Ok let's stop there with the 'I would've taken a photo with you anyways' thing. That's not what this is about. This is about someone sending unsolicited nudes," another person pointed out.\n\nIn response, @kendtee wrote that she wasn't bothered, because at the end of the day she was a "pretty woman who didn't need to be respected".\n\n"I didn't get mad or freak out or feel the need to drag his name through the mud. I just calmly informed him that I have a man in my life and that I'm flattered but I don't share photos like that and I'm taken. He didn't like it so he blocked me and I'm okay with that," she wrote.\n\nALSO ON HUFFPOST AUSTRALIA
