He had reportedly swallowed drugs and was trying to avoid police.\n\nDa Costa's family told the press that he died of a heart attack. In August, an inquest into his death was opened and adjourned. His family have vowed to take legal action against the police.\n\nThe protest on December 8, which took place after a London Black Lives Matter (BLM) meeting, was small compared to a March for Justice held the previous month. But the small group of protesters who showed up outside the London Metropolitan Police headquarters have since lodged a formal complaint with the Independent Police Complaints Commission.\n\n"We were there to make our feelings known that we don't feel safe and we don't feel protected," says Mina Abdul-Aziz, one of the activists who was outside the Met that night.\n\nThe Met insists Da Costa's death is being independently investigated.\n\n"It is essential that the facts are established," the Met said in a statement. "We are aware of concerns raised by some members of the public and the Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating the circumstances of this incident."\n\nThe protest was organized by the Newham People's Alliance, a coalition of anti-racism groups based in East London, and followed a meeting of BLMUK – a national group separate from the US-founded movement. The December protest also doubled as a launch for the People's Alliance's new campaign, "Safer Together," which will document cases of police brutality in the borough of Newham, a largely black and Asian part of East London.\n\nWhile the US-based BLM has garnered support from celebrities and white liberals, the group's London wing has had a harder time garnering support from members of the black community. While some have criticized the movement for being too white and too middle class, others say the group has not yet found its feet.\n\nMichele Sparks, a founding member of BLMUK, is determined to change that.\n\n"The BLMUK project is an urgent one. The US [movement] has woken us up to the realities that black people in this country face. And we're really keen to see a movement here that looks a lot different," she says.\n\nLondon's chapter of BLM first began to make waves on February 28, when a small group of black activists, supported by Londoners from the Ethical Society, gathered outside the US embassy in Grosvenor Square to protest against police killings of unarmed black men in the US.\n\nThat protest, which was held during the Oscars ceremony, ended with a confrontation between activists and white people who shouted racist and homophobic abuse at the activists.\n\nThe confrontations highlighted divisions within the movement. The ensuing media storm overshadowed BLMUK's bigger goals: to hold police accountable for alleged abuse, to take a stand against Britain's anti-terror policies, and to support the creation of safe spaces for black people.\n\nFounded in May 2015, BLMUK is a loose coalition of community activists, activists of color, and students. The group is working to bring more people into the fold.\n\n"One of the biggest challenges is getting more of a critical mass to come to our meetings and participate in the movement," says Sparks.\n\nSparks, who works as a freelance TV producer, is part of a subgroup that focuses on media. She helped to organize BLMUK's first national conference, which took place on October 29 in Leeds, and the group's first action on December 8.\n\nAnother group within the movement, focused on advocacy, works to bring new people into the fold.\n\n"I've been surprised by the level of response," says Mike Stuchbery, a freelance writer who founded BLMUK's advocacy group. "People are keen to get involved."\n\nStuchbery says the response has been positive, though the group's first post on its Facebook page garnered a slew of racist comments.\n\nSome critics have accused the London BLM of only taking action on behalf of black lives when they are taken overseas.\n\nOthers have questioned why the movement isn't taking a more hardline stance against the police.\n\n"They don't seem to be brave enough to stand up to the police," says Ishmahil Blagrove, who co-founded the Independent Police Complaints Commission-backed campaign #"
