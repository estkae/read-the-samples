The Good Neighbor Policy was an effort by the United States government in the 1930s to help establish an environment in the Americas that was favorable to United States interests. During the Great Depression in the United States, the public felt that the government should do more to help the needy in the country and abroad. In addition, leaders in Latin America were alarmed by the growing fascist movement in Europe.\n\nFrom 1933 to 1939, the Good Neighbor Policy was followed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Good Neighbor Policy stated that the United States was not interested in annexing Latin American countries or interfering in their governments. It was seen as a way of helping the United States avoid another war like World War I and to achieve peace and stability in the region.\n\nOne result of the Good Neighbor Policy was the decision by many Latin American countries to sever ties with Germany and Japan. These countries also rejected German and Japanese proposals to form alliances in the Americas. In addition, many Latin American countries also announced that they would not trade with Nazi Germany.\n\nFrom 1930 to 1941, the Good Neighbor Policy helped to restore trade between the United States and Latin America. It also resulted in some efforts to help poor countries develop their economies.
