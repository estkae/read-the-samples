A New York Times report on Trump’s latest financial statements show his golf properties lost money — and an overall plunge in value\n\nDonald Trump’s status as a real estate mogul has never been something he’s been shy about. Whether it’s on Twitter or in interviews, he often talks about how his companies are doing well, and it’s not just all talk: Forbes estimates his net worth at $3.1 billion, and he’s in the top 0.1 percent of wealth holders.\n\nStill, Trump’s grip on that “real estate mogul” mantle is in danger, thanks to a New York Times report that his golf courses have lost money, and that his overall wealth may be dropping.\n\nThe Times report uses Trump’s most recent financial statement to show that the valuation of his assets, including his golf courses, has decreased by more than $200 million. What’s more, his income from his businesses appears to have declined by almost half. While Trump may have been busy being president of the United States, he was also making decisions about his business, and those decisions may be impacting his personal wealth.\n\nWhat’s in the Times report?\n\nThe report comes from David Barstow, Susanne Craig, and Russ Buettner, who looked at Trump’s most recent financial disclosure form and compared it with the previous two years of his finances. As the Washington Post’s Christopher Ingraham pointed out, Trump’s 2016 form was the first time he revealed a massive loss of $916 million in the value of his stocks.\n\nThe Times report shows that this is not the only financial blow to the Trump business empire: the company’s golf courses in the United States appear to be in trouble. The Times found that each of the president’s golf courses had lost money in the past year. They may be doing a bit better now, the report says, but the revenues remain lower than Trump’s golf courses in the United States did in 2015. And according to the report, the Trump Organization is looking to move some of its golf properties in the United States to new management.\n\nOne of Trump’s properties, Trump Turnberry, reportedly had trouble attracting golfers during the time he was campaigning for president, the Times reported. The property was open only sporadically during 2016 and early 2017.\n\nThe impact on Trump’s net worth\n\nThe Times report looks at Trump’s entire business, not just his golf courses. And according to the report, the value of his assets has declined by $400 million since the last time he filed his financial disclosure form.\n\nHow does this affect his net worth? The same report points out that Forbes has repeatedly lowered its estimate of Trump’s net worth, and that their current estimate is $3.1 billion. The figure is below the $4 billion that Forbes estimated Trump’s net worth to be in 2015.\n\nThe $400 million in losses, along with Trump’s $916 million loss on the stock market and his $50 million in earnings in 2016, mean his net worth has gone down by more than $1 billion since 2016.\n\nAll of this, the report points out, leaves Trump as the richest president in US history — for now.
