Three years ago, John B. McHugh, the secretary of the Army, issued a list of seven things he felt were wrong with the service’s basic combat training.\n\nAt the top of the list was the idea that Basic Combat Training is far too long. The Army said it was conducting an extensive review of the entire process.\n\nThis week the Army, apparently satisfied with its analysis, decided to do nothing.\n\nThe basic training cycle will remain the same. The 17-week course will continue to include rifle marksmanship, unarmed combat and field training. The Army said that, as a result of its review, it found there was “no silver bullet.”\n\nThe Army conducted extensive testing and surveys to assess soldier and trainer performance. Officials said they were open to adjustments based on recommendations in the report, which is expected to be made public this summer.\n\nCommand Sgt. Maj. Marvin Hill, the senior noncommissioned officer in charge of the Army’s Comprehensive Soldier Fitness initiative, said the goal of the review was to improve soldier performance.\n\n“We are looking at the how,” he said. “The what and why are still relevant.”\n\nGen. George W. Casey Jr., the Army chief of staff, said the review indicated the system “works pretty well.”\n\n“But there are ways to make it better,” he said.\n\nWhile there is no talk about changing the basic combat training cycle, it is likely that some recommendations will be implemented to improve training in specific areas.\n\nSome of those could include addressing the issue of hazing, an area that the Army has been working on for years. A few months ago, an Army drill sergeant was convicted of hazing and sentenced to 10 months in prison.\n\nAnother recommendation that is likely to be adopted is a reduction in the number of rifle cleaning tasks a soldier must perform. Officials said that training rifle maintenance has been an issue for some time.\n\n“We think it is overtraining and we think we can pare it down,” said Col. Gary H. Jones, the commander of the Fort Jackson, S.C., training brigade.\n\nIt is likely that the Army will implement some of the findings from the study. It is not clear whether it will make changes to basic combat training as a result of the Army’s review.\n\n“What we are doing is reviewing the study,” said Lt. Col. Terry B. Leonard, a spokesman for the Army’s Training and Doctrine Command. “When the review is complete, we will discuss with senior leaders and make recommendations on how to improve the system.”\n\nOfficials said that the Army is always looking for ways to improve training.\n\n“You have to ask yourself,” said Mr. Hill, “‘Is this as good as it can be?’”\n\nThe study was led by Lt. Gen. David Huntoon Jr., who had been the commander of the Army’s Training and Doctrine Command, and by Gen. Peter Chiarelli, the vice chief of staff of the Army.\n\nThe Army’s Training and Doctrine Command was disbanded a few years ago, but Gen. Casey said that"
