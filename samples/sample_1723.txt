The area near the break is a little more protected, making it a good spot for beginner surfers to learn. Just beyond this spot, the reef begins to angle toward the shore, and the next break spot is at the point where it begins to angle back out to sea. This break is for more advanced surfers, but the waves are good and can be found right off the cliff.
