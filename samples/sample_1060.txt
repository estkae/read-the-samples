The world's first floating offshore wind farm has been officially opened off the coast of Copenhagen, hailed as a "historic" step towards cleaner energy.\n\nThe 30MW wind farm is made up of five turbines, which will power around 20,000 homes and cut carbon emissions by up to 30,000 tonnes a year, developers said.\n\nEach turbine is tethered to the seabed by a steel tube 18 metres below the water's surface.\n\nJoin Independent Minds For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just £5.99 €6.99 $9.99 a month Get the best of The Independent With an Independent Minds subscription for just £5.99 €6.99 $9.99 a month Get the best of The Independent Without the ads – for just £5.99 €6.99 $9.99 a month\n\nThe turbines rise over 100 metres into the air, with blades reaching over 70 metres.\n\nThey are expected to withstand some of the strongest winds and highest waves in the world.\n\nJohanna Haake, a project manager at Vattenfall, which led the project, said: "This is a historic day for the offshore wind industry.\n\n"I'm extremely proud of the team who have worked tirelessly to make this project a success.\n\n"Vattenfall are very pleased to have contributed to realising the vision of the wind industry and to showcase the future of green energy production."\n\nThe wind farm, which cost £240 million to construct, is located in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, about 5km from Copenhagen, which is often exposed to strong winds.\n\nThe European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre (EOWDC) project, a joint venture between Vattenfall, Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (AREG) and the Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, consists of 30MW wind turbines with 108m blades, the world’s largest to date.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies
