Our friends over at Road and Track have the scoop on what will be the new Mustang. You can read the entire article here, but it goes something like this.\n\nFord Mustang will have a larger, more powerful engine with a V8. A V6 will be offered, but as a two-seater.\n\nThe V8 will be a 5.0 liter, not a 3.7, and the V6 will have the same displacement as the current 3.7, but with the variable valve timing engine from the Ecoboost engine.\n\nIt will be called the Mustang GT, and is the car most of us are interested in.\n\nThe rear-drive GT model will be gone, replaced by an all-wheel drive GT.\n\nFord’s CVT will be the only transmission.\n\nTo be honest, I’m disappointed. The Mustang has always been about high performance.\n\nWhat is the reason for the V8 to lose power? Will we even feel the change? It is possible the V6 will make the most horsepower of all Mustang models, while still being smaller than the 5.0.\n\nDoes anyone want an all-wheel drive Mustang? Sure, you could argue that AWD will help with acceleration in the snow, but it’s pretty rare for the Northeast to get that much snow, and I don’t need all-wheel drive for an off-road trip to the Catskills.\n\nThe only reason I would consider buying an all-wheel drive Mustang is for the style. I think it will look very good.\n\nSo what do you guys think? Are you upset like I am, or are you okay with the changes?
