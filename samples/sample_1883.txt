Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3xxx-1 is to be contained at Site-58's Dimensional Anomalies Wing.\n\nYou might want to consider referring to Site-58 as just "Site-58".\n\nSCP-3xxx-1 is currently contained in a specialized variable-geometry Faraday cage. This is for the sake of preventing the spread of SCP-3xxx-2 to an even greater extent.\n\nCapitalise the "S" in "Site".\n\nDue to the constant presence of radiation from SCP-3xxx-2, it is advised to wear a radiation suit before engaging in conversation with SCP-3xxx-1.\n\nDon't say "due to" unless you have a reason for it. Also, you don't need to say "it is advised".\n\nContainment breach can be detected through the interference of cellphones and other devices emitting radio waves.\n\nThis should be moved to its own paragraph in the containment procedures, not placed where it's explaining something in the description.\n\nDescription: SCP-3xxx-1 is a humanoid entity of unknown origins, currently designated as a male due to its voice patterns and self-identification as such. SCP-3xxx-1 has a height of 170.6cm and a mass of 61.3kg.\n\nI'd like to see some sort of measurement here. "Unknown origins" is the closest you're going to get, since you don't know how far back it goes.\n\nIts biological features are average for a human being, with the exception of its eyes, which are green in colour.\n\n"With the exception of" doesn't sound right to me. I'd change this to something like "with average human biological features, with the exception of its eyes".\n\nSCP-3xxx-1 was discovered in [REDACTED], on 05/12/20██, and was recovered by the Foundation on 06/12/20██.\n\nAgain, I'd like to see some sort of measurement. Also, if you're just referring to a place in the description, just say "The Foundation recovered SCP-3xxx-1 in [REDACTED] on 05/12/20██."\n\nSCP-3xxx-1 has the ability to [REDACTED]\n\nYou don't need to censor the information here. "As part of SCP-3xxx-1's anomalous properties, it can [REDACTED]".\n\nMost of the following are for clinical tone:\n\ncompletely lacks a tongue;\n\nlacks all fingernails;\n\nis unable to talk, even when being provided with a microphone or a speaker;\n\nlacks any physical form of communication other than its eyes, with these taking on a variable colour depending on the environment in which SCP-3xxx-1 is located;\n\nseems to show signs of intelligence, with these intelligence levels being similar to that of an average human being;\n\nlacks any form of interaction, with even threatening to kill SCP-3xxx-1 not being able to evoke a response, with SCP-3xxx-1 simply looking back at the person making the threats with its eyes;\n\nThere's a lot of clinical tone here. Most of this can be reduced to "SCP-3xxx-1 lacks most normal human physical features, and cannot communicate in any way other than its eyes."\n\nHowever, SCP-3xxx-1 has shown some characteristics that it shares with other SCP objects, such as its apparent ability to read the minds of those looking at it.\n\nThat's a bit of a stretch. I'd change this to "SCP-3xxx-1 has demonstrated the ability to read the minds of those looking at it."\n\nThat being said, this doesn't really seem like an SCP article. It has some similarities to SCP-682, but doesn't quite measure up to it. You'd have to have a more extensive history to go along with this, such as something that you can't normally see, and that you might want to keep contained. Maybe something that makes it special.\n\nI'll leave this here.
