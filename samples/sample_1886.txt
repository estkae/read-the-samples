Atlas Shrugged Part 2, a movie that will not be out for another year, has already inspired an outbreak of Randianism among leading Republicans and has replaced “Tea Party” as the operative term for GOP radicals.\n\nRandism is the official philosophy of the Republican House, and Tea Party extremists are merely one strand of the Randian movement that the political press has rarely noticed.\n\nRand is a cult figure for right wingers that go to the Wall Street Journal’s Opinion Journal, Washington Times, the CATO Institute and the American Enterprise Institute, but if you look at the serious, mainstream media like the New York Times and Washington Post, the coverage of Rand and Randianism is usually minimal.\n\nYou can find Rand’s ideas undergirding almost everything the House GOP does, like the budget cuts to discretionary domestic spending, especially in education, the assaults on the Social Security system, and the overall spirit of shrillness that’s becoming the dominant characteristic of GOP discourse.\n\nAnd you can find them in the legislative philosophy of people like Rand Paul and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nPaul introduced a bill on March 15, 2011, the first day the House was in session, that would cut one third of the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget.\n\nBut the language was more than mere budget cutting. The bill was the essence of Rand’s view of what society should be and how the government should operate.\n\n“Pollution,” Paul said, “is a result of improper land use, improper development, improper allocation of resources and the failure to hold property owners accountable for their actions.”\n\nThat is an extraordinarily blunt statement of libertarian dogma, that the government should have nothing to do with the actions of private business, and that the free market will solve all problems.\n\nThe bill would also put a moratorium on the EPA’s regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, which might lead one to wonder how Paul would have voted on the Clean Air Act of 1970 that set the regulatory process in motion.\n\nRand’s ideas have had a major influence on the party’s presidential candidates, most of whom have cited her influence on their lives.\n\nIn 2011, at an event for the Atlas Society, Rand’s intellectual vehicle, that she founded in the 1960s, Gov. Rick Perry said, “Atlas Shrugged changed my life.”\n\nPerry, who may run for president again in 2016, followed this up by making a video with Rand in which he said, “I think it’s time for people to stand up and say, ‘Enough is enough.’”\n\nIn 2013, Rand Paul said, “A lot of people don’t associate me with being a believer in the free market, and that’s probably because of a lack of understanding of what I really believe. And the reason is, I do believe in the free market. I think it helps lift people out of poverty.”\n\nThis is the core of Rand’s philosophy that would, if implemented, result in vast disparities between the richest and poorest in America, but would also eliminate government regulation, such as the law that protects workers from coal miners who suffer black lung disease from being too close to the mine’s entrance.\n\nRand has also inspired a group of Republican women to call themselves “The Intellectual Yet Idiots” who routinely read excerpts from Rand’s books at meetings in the Capitol and Tea Party events.\n\nIn a book called “The Partisan: The Life of William F. Buckley Jr.,” the late National Review founder’s biographer Justin Vaisse notes that Buckley banned Atlas Shrugged from his magazine, saying that it would “undermine Christianity and lead to the collapse of the American political order.”\n\nBuckley, who served in the House from New York from 1951 to 1965, was an ardent anti-Communist and found Rand’s version of libertarianism too extreme.\n\nThat’s the irony of Rand’s rise to prominence among conservatives. In a 1985 Playboy interview, Buckley called Rand “a profoundly anti-social mind,” and that, “If there is a single theme, a single thread that runs through the work of Ayn Rand, it is her contempt for the poor.”\n\nBuckley and Rand fought constantly and with such ferocity that in 1960, Buckley said, “I do not accept, I will not accept, and I will never accept an association of any kind with that utterly contemptible creature.”\n\nIn 1980, Buckley decided that Rand had become too prominent a figure to ignore and went after her and her followers in a column titled “The Right’s Rand Re-examined.”\n\nBuckley’s magazine, and his allies, would continue to go after Rand and Randians for years afterward.\n\nToday, Rand’s influence on the GOP is enormous and it’s more than apparent. It’s so significant that if Rand were still alive, she’d probably be a GOP superstar.
