Voters have spoken and Washington has been shaken to its core. Republicans won the biggest midterm wave in modern political history, easily retaking the House of Representatives and putting the Senate back into play.\n\nThe GOP retained the seat of the Speaker of the House. That means that it will take a minimum of four years and a historic election for the Democrats to retake the House and a minimum of two more years and a near historic election for the Democrats to take back the Senate.\n\nSo what does this mean for Washington?\n\nA New Era in Washington\n\nThe 2014 midterm election will be remembered for generations as the one that ushered in a new era in Washington."
