Helium leak\n\nA helium leak is a leak of helium from its container.\n\nHelium is a diatomic gas and therefore more difficult to confine than many other gases. The inert gas may diffuse through even very small leaks into other parts of a vacuum system, or it may leak into the atmosphere. Diffusion is facilitated by higher pressure on one side of a barrier. One way of countering this effect is to use helium's very low solubility in common materials. Helium also may leak into vacuum systems from poorly-made, improperly-applied, or damaged seals. \n\nHelium leak detectors use a small electric current through a coil inside the container to detect leaks. They are often found in high-vacuum and ultra-high-vacuum systems.\n\nAt room temperature, helium leaks through most materials at a rate of about one molecule every 10 seconds. If a"
