The story takes place in the near future in Japan, which has become a battlefield in a proxy war between the U.S. and the U.K., but the war has gone badly and Japan's defeat is imminent. The island of Shikotan (漁港) is currently occupied by U.S. forces, but the U.S. Government agrees to return Shikotan to Japanese control and withdraw all troops in exchange for a letter of Japanese surrender and control of the Kuril Islands.\n\nIn addition, the government secretly requests U.S. help to turn Shikotan into a military base. In this case, they are going to give the Kuril Islands to the U.S. to build a military base there instead. In exchange, Japan will continue to get help from the U.S. for as long as they need it. This plan to hand over the Kuril Islands to the U.S. in exchange for their support to turn Shikotan into a military base is strongly opposed by the Japanese public, but the situation becomes critical when Russia, fearing that the U.S. will control Japan, sends a military force to Shikotan in an attempt to seize the island. In the middle of the battle, the Japanese government is taken over by a group of Japanese nationalists who plan to destroy all Japanese military bases and surrender to the U.S. When a mysterious young man comes to Shikotan, the Japanese Self-Defense Force, and even a U.S. army, are swept up into the battle.
