Something Wicked This Way Comes was a band that put out two EPs, but disbanded before they could do anything else. The self-titled EP is a more metal oriented affair than One More Day, but it still has a polished, high quality sound. They're known for the metal/rock track Fear and a cover of Badlands by Bruce Springsteen. The latter track is very good. The former track has a somewhat weaker rock sound, and doesn't seem to fit with the other songs on the EP. While I prefer One More Day overall, this EP is definitely worth hearing.
