"Who loves to get work done and then get a massage! The JOB chair allows you to work and receive a massage. It is the combination of a massage chair and a desk chair. It allows you to receive a full body massage while working. The design of this chair allows you to either get a massage on your back, while your work, or on your arms and shoulders while you work. This allows you to relax and work at the same time.\n\nDesigner: Mindscapes
