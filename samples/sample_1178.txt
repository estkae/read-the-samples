As it turns out, we all might need more than the 50-million job target that the new government has promised to deliver.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi seems to be fully convinced that there is nothing a government can’t do if it has the will. He has decided to do something that might take a few years, but, if done, will be transformational.\n\nHis first decision in this direction has been to initiate what has come to be called the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao (BBBP) campaign to bring up the condition of girl children in the country. His second decision has been to initiate a new housing policy to ensure affordable housing to everyone.\n\nIt will be fair to say that India is facing a major problem in the form of inadequate jobs. And the solution lies in generating more employment and in the process increasing our productive capacity.\n\nAccording to a World Bank report released last week, India has a whopping 50 million youth who are neither employed nor in education and training (NEEF) in the 15-24 age group. According to the same report, this figure is more than double of the number of unemployed in the same age group (25 million).\n\nThe report, prepared jointly by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs and the Population Division of the United Nations, is titled: World Employment and Social Outlook: Trends for Youth 2015. It has been prepared on the basis of data from 189 countries.\n\nAccording to the report, while India has 50 million youth in the age group of 15-24 who are NEETs (not in employment, education or training), in Pakistan, the figure is only 19 million. The report also notes that South Asia accounts for over a quarter of the world’s youth population (which is 816 million). The majority of youth in the region are located in India (258 million) and Pakistan (124 million). In addition, in India alone, there are 258 million adults in the age group of 25-54, most of whom are likely to be in the labour force.\n\nThe report is relevant, because it is the first time that a report on youth employment has been compiled by the World Bank, which is headquartered in Washington, DC. While most studies have traditionally concentrated on adult employment, this is the first report to take into account the fact that a large number of youth in the world remain outside the labour force and they constitute a major challenge.\n\nThe report notes that the high share of youth not in employment, education or training (NEET) and the low share of youth in employment (just one-third of 15-24 years of age) have important implications for policy-making and for understanding the future impact of demographic changes on the labour market.\n\nThe"
