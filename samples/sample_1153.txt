Social Media Overload\n\nThe average American spends 4.7 hours a day using social media, according to Nielsen. Of course, if you’re reading this blog, you’re probably already aware of that number and much higher.\n\nFacebook still accounts for the largest share of that time, about 1.7 hours a day. And it’s likely that you’re spending more time on Facebook than you think. In fact, a recent study found that users who check their Facebook feed less frequently (and presumably are more conscious of the fact that they’re on Facebook) report feeling more negatively about their time spent on the social network than users who check Facebook more frequently. The reason: frequent Facebook users were not fully aware of the amount of time they were spending on the site.\n\nFacebook’s desire to keep you on the site is apparent in how it ranks updates in your feed. Updating your status is much more likely to show up on your friends’ News Feeds if they spend more time on the site, which is why there’s a nudge to “write something on your friend’s wall” in the status update box.\n\nEven when you’re not actually on Facebook, it’s working on ways to keep you in its orbit. The company released a study earlier this year that found that Facebook is just as good at keeping you connected to your friends as your spouse is.\n\nHere’s another fact for you: while it might seem like Facebook is eating up your whole day, the average user spends only about 15 minutes per day on the site. But that’s still not that much.\n\nA study by Stoppelman found that of the two hours and 17 minutes users spend on the Internet each day, an average of half an hour is spent on Facebook. (Interestingly, the study also found that 25% of users spend less than five minutes on Facebook each day).\n\nSome more numbers: the average Facebook user has 130 friends and creates 90 pieces of content (posts, photos, and links) each month. According to a Facebook report, users share 2.4 pieces of content per day. On a day that Facebook has a new feature or event, that number jumps to four.\n\nFacebook is clearly focused on keeping people on the site. In fact, a recent study from the University of Wisconsin showed that Facebook is not just keeping its users there — it’s actually altering their brains, making it more difficult for people to keep their attention away from the site.\n\nThe company has even toyed with the idea of charging users to remove ads, but apparently it’s not planning to follow through on the plan.\n\nOther stats:\n\n– 200 million photos per day are uploaded to Facebook.\n\n– More than 25 million people play Facebook games every day.\n\n– Each month, people send around 750 million private Facebook messages.\n\n(Check out our Inside Scoop post for more Facebook stats.)\n\nThe same study that found Facebook users underestimate their time on the site also revealed that they underestimated the amount of time they spent on YouTube, too. According to Nielsen, users spend an average of 15 minutes a day on YouTube — compared to the 20 minutes per day they report.\n\nAccording to Nielsen, the most popular video topics on YouTube in 2012 were music, news, and celebrity/ gossip. (Other popular topics include “how to,” “funny,” “dance,” and “news.”)\n\nWhen it comes to time spent, YouTube is a close second to Facebook: Nielsen’s research found that people spend 15 minutes a day on YouTube, which is only about two minutes less than they spend on Facebook.\n\nAnd, while the vast majority of YouTube videos are viewed on a desktop or laptop, mobile viewing is increasing. According to the company, the number of users who watch YouTube videos on mobile devices increased by 75% in 2012, to more than 1 billion views per day.\n\nNumbers: 4.7 hours a day spent on social media, 1.7 hours a day spent on Facebook, and 15 minutes a day spent on YouTube.\n\n[Image Credit: Flickr user Magnus D]
