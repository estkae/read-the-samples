Forgive me if this has been answered already.\n\n\n\nI bought a standard prepaid plan and activated it last week. I purchased the standard plan with 1 GB of data and 1 GB of minutes and unlimited texts.\n\n\n\nToday, I purchased a pre-paid plan with 1 GB of data and 3 GB of minutes and unlimited texts. When I added the new plan to my phone, it overwrote my previous plan with only 1 GB of data.\n\n\n\nWhen I called Koodo, I was told that I could not keep both plans.\n\n\n\nIs this correct? Can I not use 2 different pre-paid plans? I don't want to lose the 1 GB of data in my phone because it's a limited offer.\n\n\n\nThanks
