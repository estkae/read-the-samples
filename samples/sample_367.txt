Granted, my current policy does not meet what I want to do, so I have done some thinking on what changes would be nice. There are two major changes I think should be made.\n\nThe first would be to include the deletion policy as the first part of the “FAQ” section, as opposed to the second, where it is now. The issue here is that it is currently hidden away, and unless you know to go there, you might not even know it exists. This is why I believe the policy should be in the FAQ, in addition to the other policy changes.\n\nThe second major change would be to change the time periods for deleting and undeletion requests. Currently, these time periods are a month for both and can be extended for a total of 2 months. These time periods need to be shortened. If a user creates an account, and decides it is not for them within a week, they should be able to delete it without the issue being made public, since no other users have commented on it. If a user creates an account and decides that it is not for them within the first month, they should also be able to delete it without it being made public. Also, it is not fair to users who are newer, and decide that they do not wish to use the site for the first time period to only have it deleted. These users should be able to delete them after this time period if they choose. I believe these time periods should be a month for deletion requests, and 2 weeks for undeletion requests.
