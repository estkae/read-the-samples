Pueblo County and a water provider say they have come to a “mutual understanding” on a controversial decision last month that curbed water supply to a community south of Pueblo.\n\nLast month, the Colorado Springs Water Works announced it would cut water supply to two water districts that buy its water because the Pueblo Reservoir was too low to pump water into the Pueblo County’s Jimmie Creek Reservoir.\n\nThat reservoir, which supplies water to about 20,000 people south of Pueblo, had been on a rotating “water conservation” restriction for more than a year.\n\nJim May, manager of the CSWW, said the restrictions were intended to help the reservoir fill faster, but the cuts to the districts south of Pueblo appeared to exacerbate the problem.\n\nAfter the announcement last month, residents and water officials in Pueblo and Pueblo County wrote to the state saying they believed the restrictions were discriminatory. They argued that residents in the water districts that purchase the water were being punished for water overuse by residents of Pueblo and Pueblo County, even though they don’t buy the water.\n\nThe Pueblo County commissioners sent a letter to CSWW last month that said, in part: “We do not consider that the Pueblo Reservoir can be drained without impact to the water service area, and it is our position that this is discriminatory.”\n\nThe commissioners sent another letter Tuesday saying the county is committed to working with the Colorado Springs Water Works on this issue and future water issues.\n\nCSWW agreed to issue a second letter to water districts in Pueblo and Pueblo County clarifying that water would be available.\n\nThe districts that had been receiving water have already begun taking the water again, said Dennis Tenorio, general manager of the Northern Water Users Association. He said the water districts bought a $200,000 storage tank to hold water when there is a shortage.\n\nMay said CSWW has worked with the districts to understand why the Pueblo Reservoir’s level is low and how to address the problem.\n\n“There’s a huge, huge amount of water being used up there,” May said. “But, with this mutual understanding, I’m confident we’ll be able to make this a long-term fix for everyone.”\n\nTim Hoover: 303-954-1626, thoover@denverpost.com or twitter.com/timhoover
