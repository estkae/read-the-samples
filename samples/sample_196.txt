One of my favourite times in the barbershop. I love conversations with guys about life, business, sex, sports and news.\n\n\n\nA friend of mine said, "The best conversations happen over a good cup of coffee".\n\n\n\nThat’s what I’ve done in my new book... ‘Good Coffee, Bad Conversations’.\n\n\n\nIf you’ve got a few minutes, I’d like to share a story with you.\n\n\n\nIn the late 90’s, my business partner, Jeff – a good friend of mine and also a barber – was having problems. He was having lots of conflict with his wife and daughter and he was angry all the time.\n\n\n\nI asked him if he wanted to talk about it.\n\n\n\nHe said, “No. That would be good coffee, bad conversation.”\n\n\n\nIt’s true, Jeff was scared to open up and share what was really going on in his life. He was afraid of what he would hear.\n\n\n\nI remember this time because I wanted to help Jeff, but I didn’t know what to do. So I did the only thing I knew how to do.\n\n\n\nI started writing.\n\n\n\nAs I wrote, I realized that coffee was a lot like conversation.\n\n\n\nA cup of coffee was good.\n\n\n\nA cup of coffee was bad.\n\n\n\nThat’s when it hit me... ‘Good Coffee, Bad Conversations’.\n\n\n\nIt’s about the conversations we have and how they can make or break our lives.\n\n\n\nIn my book, I show you the seven bad conversations you need to stop having. You’ll also learn the seven good conversations you should start having instead.\n\n\n\nAs a bonus, I also share the six good conversations I’ve had with some amazing people including Grant Cardone, Kody Deis, Andy Frisella, Gary Vaynerchuk and others.\n\n\n\nThere’s more, but you’ll have to read it to find out.\n\n\n\nThe book is short and concise.
