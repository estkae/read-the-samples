Not again!\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nA Stock Phrase that can be used when a character has been backed into a corner and is preparing for a fight. It can either be the ultimate badass moment, or can serve to show that the character is a Dirty Coward. If the character doesn't finish the phrase it will usually be used for the former, while finishing the phrase often makes it the latter.\n\nCompare Badass Boast, Ineffectual Death Threat, and Pre-Asskicking One-Liner, which this trope often overlaps with.\n\nThis is the opposite of the Pre-Mortem One-Liner.\n\nNot to be confused with the album Pre-Ass-Kicking by Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nExamples:\n\nopen/close all folders\n\nAnime & Manga\n\nComic Books\n\nFan Works\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nFilms — Animation\n\nFilms — Live-Action\n\nLiterature\n\nLive-Action TV\n\nMusic\n\nThe Lonely Island song "Natalie's Rap" from their second album Incredibad features a series of these, with Natalie Portman dissing Ashlee Simpson.

They're here to save it!\n\nJeff: Save it from mediocrity!\n\nMatt: Save it from corruption!\n\nJeff: Save it from fake-ass, piece-of-shit, garbage wrestlers!\n\nMatt: Woken Warriors are coming to save it!\n\nJeff: And we are here to take your house, we are here to take your crown, and we are here to take your soul!\n\nMatt: And we are here to change the way you do business!\n\nJeff: We are here to change your wrestling business!\n\nMatt: Yeah, that's right!\n\nJeff: Woken Warriors are born!\n\nTheatre\n\nAntony in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar has a particularly good one: My name is Anthony,\n\nI am a Roman. Kneel not, princes, kneel not, I beseech you all,\n\nI am a lover of the public weal,\n\nI am Anthony, and I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
