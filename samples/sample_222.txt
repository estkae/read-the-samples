Description\n\nOn 2 June 1945 in the Tiergarten of Berlin, hours after Hitler had committed suicide, Major-General Hans Krebs (with his right hand raised) signed the German instrument of surrender. The capitulation of all German forces to the Allies was unconditional.The Reich Chancellery in Berlin was chosen for the signing. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin had insisted on a place in Berlin, his army had reached the city ahead of the others, and he had expressed a wish to receive the capitulation in his capital. The same location had been used for the signing of the surrender of Germany by the Russian army in November 1918. The others present were the Soviet military commander Marshal Georgi Zhukov, U.S. General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, and British Field Marshal Sir Bernard Law Montgomery, whose signatures appear at the bottom. This moment is often said to be the end of World War II, but is not the date used for official purposes. The terms of the surrender were finally worked out in Esen, on the river Mulde, between 24 and 27 April 1945, and approved by Eisenhower and Zhukov on 4 May. The official document (the text of which is in the final picture) was signed in Berlin in the evening of 8 May. It was ratified by the Soviet government on 1 September 1945 and by the other allies later.
