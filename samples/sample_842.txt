Rated 5 out of 5 by veronicajbrn from great quality I love the idea of a rack that I can use to hang my laundry instead of using a dryer. So far it has worked great. There is enough room for even my larger clothes. I love the little compartments for my washcloths.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by mackinac9 from Perfect for a small apartment We recently moved to a small apartment and have limited storage space. This is a perfect solution for small spaces as it does not take up a lot of room and can be used for other things when not in use as a laundry rack.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by smartgal from great product ! We bought 2 to use as drying racks for small items - even used it to hang our 'flip-flops' on when going to the beach. You could use this rack for lots of things - just be creative.\n\nRated 4 out of 5 by elaine19 from Excellent space saver This little rack is exactly what I was looking for. It is extremely light and portable and folds up to be very compact. I don't have a clothes dryer so it makes it easy to air dry clothes.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Linda1953 from Excellent product. This was a perfect space saver and will be using this for a long time. Excellent product and I have already recommended it to many people.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Chicagoan from Exactly what I needed! This is a great product, and is perfect for a single person who needs to conserve space. I hang my sweaters and washcloths on it, and my dress shirts and jeans on it. I can't believe that I finally found the perfect product!\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by huddie from This product is very convenient. It makes drying clothes much easier than using a clothes line.
