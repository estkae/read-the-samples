"Univision Acquires 7% Stake In Hulu, Plus 20 Episodes Of Televisa's 'La Que No Podia Amar'\n\nIn another sign of how serious Univision is about its investments in online video, the Spanish-language network has purchased a 7% stake in Hulu, according to a report from the Los Angeles Times. That makes Univision the first Spanish-language TV network to take an equity stake in Hulu.\n\nThe $600 million deal between Univision and News Corp., which owns 30 percent of Hulu, also includes an agreement to put 20 episodes of Televisa’s telenovela “La Que No Podia Amar” on Hulu’s site.\n\nHulu’s new owners had already put a major emphasis on Spanish-language programming, having made a deal with Telemundo that led to six Telemundo series getting put online.\n\nAnd last month, Hulu and Univision teamed up on a joint venture called the Hispanic Television Alliance, designed to develop cross-platform partnerships and business opportunities that benefit the companies and Hispanic viewers.\n\nWhile many have been skeptical that Hulu would turn a profit on its original programming, CEO Jason Kilar said last month that online TV had a shot at “redefining television.”\n\nThe success of Hulu, which has a $5.99-a-month subscription fee, has been credited to its strong library of content and its model that lets users watch full seasons of shows that air on broadcast TV.
