The ethos of the Linton Brook Trust is one of social inclusion and it is this very ethos that led to our collaboration with Artrix and the Festival of Baroque Music.\n\nAs the charity aims to ‘support the life chances of young people and communities in the West Midlands’, we worked with Artrix and the Festival of Baroque Music to enhance the experience of those that took part in a specific part of the music festival, which this year was Bach. The charity worked with Artrix to include a programme of interactive workshops that took place on the Friday of the festival. The workshops engaged in conversations about art, music and philosophy. They also introduced the young people to musicians and performers, who in turn shared their knowledge about their own experiences in music and how it has influenced their own journey.\n\nOne of the workshops encouraged the young people to experiment with a variety of instruments and create an original composition. Another workshop, which explored the different genres of classical music, demonstrated how the young people could use their creative thinking to connect with other styles of music. The young people also engaged in philosophical discussions about music and life. They learned about the difference between performing music and listening to music, and they discussed what a performance is.\n\nLinton Brook’s involvement in the festival led to a strong working relationship with the festival organisers, who have expressed their interest in building a lasting relationship with the charity. This will mean Linton Brook can look at other ways it can collaborate with the festival to benefit more young people and their communities.\n\nFind out more about Linton Brook and the work that they do by visiting the website.
