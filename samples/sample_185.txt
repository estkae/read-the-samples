Embarrassing tax mistake gives a false impression that tax gap is falling at a time when it is rising\n\nThe government’s much heralded fall in the tax gap may have been boosted by an embarrassing tax ‘error’, which has skewed official figures to suggest that the amount of tax which goes unpaid is falling.\n\nHM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has admitted that a major error in the way it handles unpaid taxes from firms using the banking system has overstated its tax gap – the amount of tax which goes unpaid – and understated the number of people working under the taxman’s radar.\n\nIn a document on its website, it admitted that it has been failing to record taxes which should have been received but were not, but said it did not ‘understate’ the size of the tax gap.\n\n‘The effects of this error are that the statistics do not represent a full year’s tax gap and do not fully represent the HMRC compliance work,’ it said.\n\nThe error means that the tax gap fell from £35 billion in 2014/15 to £33.2 billion last year, when in fact the correct figure would have been £39.5 billion.\n\nThe mistake means that the tax gap is now out by more than £5 billion.\n\nThe admission follows a series of problems for the HMRC. The organisation was accused of losing sensitive personal data on more than 10 million people in an unencrypted CD in 2015, and was also accused of sending the wrong letters to half a million people.\n\nIt has also been criticised for a raid on the offices of investigative reporters at The Guardian.\n\nAn HMRC spokesperson said: ‘It has become clear that our compliance data is not fully comparable over time, and we will not be publishing it in this form again. This does not affect the overall tax gap and our published estimates of the tax gap for the years 2014-15 and 2015-16 have not changed.’\n\nA statement on the HMRC website said that the data published on 31 August ‘estimated the total tax gap to be £33.2 billion for the year 2015-16. This figure represents a decrease of £4.7 billion on the 2014-15 tax gap of £38.9 billion, or a 14 per cent decrease’.\n\nBut it admitted that the figure included ‘incorrect estimates’ on income tax, VAT and customs duty.\n\n‘We have corrected this error and published revised estimates for income tax, VAT and customs duty. These estimates now estimate the total tax gap to be £39.5 billion for the year 2015-16, which is an increase of £4.3 billion on the 2014-15 tax gap of £35.2 billion,’ it said.\n\n‘This increase in the tax gap is not a true reflection of what has happened in compliance. It is because the 2015-16 estimates have included the correction of the error which has overstated the 2014-15 tax gap.’
