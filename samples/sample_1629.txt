Nasal cavity\n\nThe nasal cavity is the cavity located in the middle of the face inside the nose.\n\nThe nasal cavity is also referred to as the nasal airway.\n\nThis cavity communicates with the outside through the nostrils, also called nares, and is lined with skin. It has a series of bony shelves called conchae (singular: concha) which help to filter air during inhalation and to warm and humidify the air during exhalation.\n\nThe nasal cavity can also be divided into three distinct sections: the vestibule, the middle meatus, and the anterior meatus.\n\nThe nasal cavity receives:\n\nNasal conchae are small, irregular bony projections into the nasal cavity that help to warm and humidify air.\n\nOn each side, the lateral nasal wall has three or four of these, which project from the inferior margin of the orbit and of the zygomatic process, to the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and constitute the superior, middle and inferior meatuses of the nose.\n\nThe lateral wall is the wall of the nasal cavity located on the lateral side of the nose.\n\n\nThe anterior nasal spine (or anterior nasal concha) is the bony ridge located on the middle nasal concha on the inferior portion of the lateral nasal wall.\n\nIt is about 5 mm long and 2 mm thick and is the remnant of the cartilage of the embryonic nasal capsule.\n\nThe medial nasal wall is the wall of the nasal cavity located on the medial side of the nose.\n\n\n
