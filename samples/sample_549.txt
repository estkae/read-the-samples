Updated to add comment from Shona Keene\n\nA 33-year-old B.C. man who drove from Vancouver to pick up his dog from a P.E.I. animal shelter, then drove back to B.C. with it, will have to fight a charge of violating quarantine regulations.\n\nDarcy Jewell was charged under the Health Protection and Promotion Act.\n\nHis one-year-old labrador retriever, Oreo, was put in a quarantine kennel at the P.E.I. Humane Society.\n\nUnder the act, dogs are not allowed into P.E.I. unless they come from one of four designated “pre-approved” kennels, or a veterinarian’s office.\n\nThe province is trying to prevent the spread of rabies, which has not been found on the Island in at least 50 years.\n\nPeople on the Island who wanted to bring their dogs here, and weren’t sure about the regulations, had been asked to get in touch with P.E.I.’s animal control office.\n\nCBC P.E.I.’s Jessica Doria-Brown spoke with a staff member from the Humane Society who said the man who picked up the dog had said it was for a short visit.\n\nDogs that have to be quarantined for more than 10 days in P.E.I. are transported to the IWK in Halifax.\n\nThe Humane Society has not responded to our request for comment.\n\nCharges were laid after the Department of Health and Wellness received a complaint, the province’s Health Minister told CBC.\n\n“The concern that we have with rabies is that it’s not something that can be easily dealt with,” Robert Mitchell said.\n\n“If someone has the illness, they can spread it to other animals, and people are at risk.”\n\nMitchell said it’s up to the RCMP to enforce the regulations, and that he can’t comment on the specific case.\n\n“I’m not aware of any other such incidents,” Mitchell said. “It’s a very serious offence and I would certainly hope that people would be able to be advised on what the requirements are.”\n\nMitchell said that “If it turns out that there was an offence, then it’s the responsibility of the individual to be charged.”\n\nThe case will be heard in provincial court on Sept. 24.
