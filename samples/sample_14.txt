"Apple’s ResearchKit is off to a good start, but there’s plenty of work to be done.\n\n\n\nResearchKit was launched in March as a way for Apple’s developers to easily tap into medical data from the iPhone to help researchers track and collect information about a variety of health conditions. Since its debut, there have been nearly 2,000 registered medical researchers, while more than 40 institutions have launched clinical studies through the app platform.\n\n\n\nBut there are several hurdles for Apple and its partners. On Wednesday, Dr. Harvey Fineberg, president of the Institute of Medicine, will join at a panel discussion at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York to examine what works and what’s missing in the fast-evolving field of mobile health.\n\n\n\nThe session, titled “What Are the Future Directions for ResearchKit?” comes after a first wave of successful projects on ResearchKit, including apps that help people manage diabetes, heart disease and asthma.\n\n\n\nThere are also some examples of the problems Apple is facing as it tries to get more partners to adopt the tool. Earlier this month, a major player in the diabetes community said it would not be taking part in the app’s data collection. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation said in a statement that its members were not interested in the iPhone platform and “would prefer to conduct research studies using our own patient data that is gathered on an Android platform.”\n\n\n\nThat’s likely an expensive prospect for the organization, given the popularity of iPhones in the United States. As of last year, Android devices accounted for just over half of all U.S. smartphone subscribers, while iOS devices made up around 41 percent. That’s according to the Pew Research Center, which estimated last year that there were 121 million iPhone users in the United States.\n\n\n\nThe success of Apple’s platform will hinge in part on how it handles data privacy and security concerns. Apple had to clear some hurdles in the early days of ResearchKit because many people were concerned about privacy when they heard it would rely on data from Apple’s servers. Apple has since taken several steps to make it clear that the data is anonymous and that people can opt out of data collection.\n\n\n\nThe app program could also be a major part of the iPhone’s future if it takes off. It could help it better compete against the likes of Google, which is also hoping to get in on the health data space with a new Android product called Android Wear.\n\n\n\nThe first public version of ResearchKit will be unveiled on Wednesday, the panel will also include representatives from Mount Sinai and Pfizer.\n\n\n\nThat event will be at 11:30 a.m. EDT in New York City, and it will be livestreamed on Fortune’s website.
