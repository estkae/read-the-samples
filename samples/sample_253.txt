A Jersey City firefighter, one of the department’s most seasoned, has been stripped of his rank and placed on administrative leave as a result of alleged sexual harassment and stalking.\n\nThe city took the action against James Fitzpatrick, a 13-year veteran, last month, according to police and fire officials.\n\nFitzpatrick, who has worked at Engine 6, told The Jersey Journal he is appealing his demotion and administrative leave and does not admit to the accusations.\n\n“They’re saying this is harassment and stalking, but I don’t know what else to do,” he said. “I just want to talk to her.”\n\nCity spokeswoman Jennifer Morrill said Jersey City law prohibits her from discussing the matter because it is a personnel issue.\n\nThe Journal reported in October that city police had been investigating Fitzpatrick on a complaint that he sent hundreds of harassing and harassing and stalking text messages to a firefighter who works at a different firehouse.\n\nCity officials said at the time that they knew of at least 200 messages. The city launched an investigation and suspended Fitzpatrick with pay in November, and he was demoted on Jan. 8.\n\nThe suspended firefighter and police said they were not aware of any criminal charges against Fitzpatrick.\n\n“We are investigating it and reviewing it internally,” Morrill said last month. “There is no further information at this time.”\n\nFitzpatrick, a Marine Corps veteran who has been with the Jersey City Fire Department for 13 years, said he is appealing his demotion and administrative leave.\n\nHe said he received a letter from the city in December saying his leave was the result of a “personnel matter,” but he said he has not been able to see the letter’s contents because it is sealed by the city’s law department.\n\n“They’re saying this is harassment and stalking, but I don’t know what else to do,” he said. “I just want to talk to her.”\n\nFitzpatrick said he met the firefighter while they were both in college, and the two became good friends. Fitzpatrick said he started sending her text messages in September because she had not returned his calls. He said he sent her messages out of concern that she was missing work because she was depressed.\n\nThe messages were more than once a day, he said, and he said he never threatened the woman.\n\nThe woman’s lawyer, Susan Ross, said last month that Fitzpatrick sent “more than 200 harassing and stalking text messages.”\n\n“The harassment has included threats to my client's life,” she said.\n\nRoss did not respond to a request for comment this week.\n\nFitzpatrick’s wife, Cheryl Fitzpatrick, said the situation has been difficult for their two young daughters, who know nothing about the accusations.\n\n“My husband is an outstanding fireman,” she said. “It has been very difficult on my children.”\n\nTerrence T.
