'Have I been taking part in inappropriate jokes or language?' 'Have I been assuming that women will do a certain type of job?' 'Have I been assuming that women aren't interested in a certain type of job?' 'Have I been excluding women from certain conversations? (Sexual harassment doesn't have to be verbal.)' 'Have I been making assumptions about what women do or don't do in the office, or treating women differently based on stereotypes?' 'Have I ever given unsolicited advice on women's appearance or fashion?' 'Have I ever told a woman she was getting ahead in her career too fast and to slow down?' 'Have I ever told a woman that she was being treated differently in the workplace because she was a woman?' 'Have I ever said anything in the workplace that left"
