And on the flip side…\n\nSix men have come forward alleging sex abuse at the hands of Republican Donald Trump in an exclusive report from The Daily Beast.\n\nAccording to the report, four men who spoke to The Daily Beast said that Trump had walked in on them changing while they were teen beauty pageant contestants. Two of the men said Trump had groped them.\n\nThree of the men have not spoken to the press before. The fourth, who now lives in the Chicago area, agreed to speak on the record. The fifth man’s allegations have been made to other media outlets, but he agreed to speak on the record to The Daily Beast.\n\n“This was ‘Trumped!’ in the New York media market,” said Harry Waisbren, an owner of the agency representing some of the accusers, who previously worked as an executive for the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA pageants.\n\nTwo of the men also said that Trump had walked into the dressing room while contestants were naked. The third accuser said Trump had watched him changing through a doorway.\n\n“I remember putting on my suit really quick because I was like, ‘Oh my god, there’s a man in here,’” said Mariah Billado, who represented Vermont in the 1997 Miss Teen USA pageant. “Donald Trump just walks right in. There was no second to put a robe on or any sort of clothing or anything. Some girls were topless. Other girls were naked.”\n\n“He just came strolling right in. There was no second to put a robe on or any sort of clothing or anything,” she said. “Some girls were topless. Other girls were naked.”\n\nBillado added that Trump did not offer her or other women any money after he intruded on them.\n\nThe other three accusers did not provide their names to The Daily Beast. They said that Trump had come into the dressing room while girls were changing, including when the contestants were nude. Two of them added that Trump had groped them.\n\n“I remember putting on my dress really quick because I was like, ‘Oh my god, there’s a man in here,’” said the former Miss Washington. “He was like, ‘Don’t worry, ladies, I’ve seen it all before.’”\n\nThe woman said Trump had initially entered the dressing room while the contestants were “half naked” and speculated that he “sort of knew” the contestants would be naked at that point.\n\n“The time that he walked through the dressing rooms was really shocking. We were all naked,” she said. “He was probably one of the most ashamed people to walk through that dressing room.”\n\nA fourth woman, who also did not provide her name, said that Trump had walked into the dressing room of contestants in their underwear.\n\nThe contestant said that Trump had first come into the dressing room while they were wearing robes and many contestants were topless.\n\n“I remember putting on my dress really quick because I was like, ‘Oh my god, there’s a man in here,’” she told The Daily Beast. “He was like, ‘Don’t worry, ladies, I’ve seen it all before.’”\n\nAccording to the contestant, Trump had come back in and walked “right in front” of her and other contestants as they were changing into their costumes.\n\n“He was basically saying, ‘These are beautiful women and I can do anything I want,’” she said. “‘You can get naked and do anything.’”\n\n“He was maybe 7 feet away from me,” she added. “So I could physically see him, and he was looking right at me.”\n\nWhen asked what he did while in the dressing room, the woman said, “He was just staring, it was definitely a weird moment.”\n\nThe woman, who was 18 at the time, was not only upset by Trump’s presence in the room but also by how he had described the contestants to her and other contestants.\n\n“He started saying to us, ‘Don’t worry, ladies, I’ve seen it all before. I’ve done all of this,’” the woman said. “I was in a state of shock.”\n\nTwo other Miss Teen USA contestants, who"
