"How to turn "Long Press Home" into "Open Google Now"\n\nWhen you hold down the home button on the Google Nexus 5, you get Google Now. So what happens when you use a home button launcher, or just want to do something else with the button? If you've rooted, you could always remap the button to open Google Now in a non-press manner, but that's tedious, and who wants to be bothered with that when you could automate it?\n\nIn the Google Search app, under the "Voice" settings, there's an option called "Press Home for." Select that, then scroll down to the bottom and check the box labeled "Google Now" to enable the new voice action. Now, you can activate Google Now with your home button's long-press, just like you did before.\n\nPrevious Page 1 2
