The Boy Who Would be a King\n\nWhile discussing the biblical story of Balaam and his donkey, I thought it would be fun to review one of my favorite books of all time: The Prince of Egypt, by Steven Hickman.\n\nThe movie (which I have not yet seen, by the way) is loosely based on the life of Moses, but the book is about Joshua, the man who led the Israelites to the promised land.\n\nThis book, first published in 1982, is absolutely fantastic. A third-person telling of the life of Joshua, from his birth to his death, it tells his story in a very gripping manner. Itâ€™s exciting and fun to read, yet has some serious substance in the way of historical accuracy.\n\nI would highly recommend this book, even for those who are not interested in Christian books. The book is simply that good.
