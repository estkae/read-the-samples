When it comes to natural beauty, words can't begin to describe this place. Looking out over the crashing waves, no man-made thing in sight, the solitude and vastness of the region makes your mind race to contemplate the universe. You're in awe, and yet, still feel a deep sense of comfort and belonging. It is a very special place, where it is easy to feel at peace. Whether you are at the lodge, by the pool, on a zodiac tour, or on a hike, you'll have a renewed sense of wonder and thankfulness for the wonders of this world.\n\nHow did you fall in love with your profession?\n\nOne of my fondest childhood memories is sitting in the car and looking at the grand, bright stars at night. I felt very much connected to the heavens, and longed to be an astronomer. As I got older, and I realized my dreams were much more achievable in the fashion world, I just sort of went with it. But, I always loved working with my hands and creating things, and that was what eventually brought me back to a love of astronomy.\n\nWhat is your favorite design element to work with?\n\nI love working with the raw materials of the earth, rocks, precious metals, and yes, even sand. It is fascinating to see these things and consider their origins. The best part is turning them into things that other people can use and appreciate.\n\n\n\nWhat was the last design you made?\n\nI made a ring for a recent film shoot, featuring several pieces of meteorite I had acquired. It was a great project to work on.\n\n\n\nWhat is your go-to travel item?\n\nI love our Infinite Earth candle, and I always carry it with me when I travel. It smells like the ocean, and makes the room smell good! I think the ocean is one of the most amazing places on Earth, so it is my go-to place for inspiration.
