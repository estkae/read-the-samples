"The unit\n\nFor most of this article, we’ll be focusing on one single computer system: an HP Pavilion Elite HPE-335f. It's an interesting machine that bridges the gap between high-end workstations and lower-cost multimedia systems.\n\nThe system comes with an Intel Core i7-870 2.93GHz processor, 6GB of RAM, a 1TB hard drive, and an Nvidia GeForce GT230 video card. With all of the RAM and a 2GB video card, this system could run most games on the market, but there are a few weaknesses that we’ll be taking advantage of during our experiment.\n\nThe power supplies\n\nLet’s talk about power supplies. The Elite HPE-335f comes with a 460W power supply. This is one of the worst power supplies you can get, but is unfortunately one of the best ones for this experiment. Why is it bad? We’ll talk about that in a bit.\n\nThe power supply is not well-regarded in the hardware world because it has some serious design flaws that make it inefficient, which means it wastes power. That also means it produces a lot of heat, which means that it will use even more power, which means that it will waste even more power.\n\nIf you’re wondering, this is why the power supply is a little hotter than usual. But it is not the source of our problem.\n\nThe problem\n\nThe problem is that the power supply’s fan is also weak and poorly mounted. It is a plastic fan, not a metal one, so it’s no surprise that it can’t keep up with the heat that the system is producing.\n\nNow, instead of making the fan stronger, the company (which is a common practice in the industry) tried to use a resistor to reduce the fan speed. Here’s the thing: That resistor can only handle a certain amount of power, and the fan pulls a lot of power. When you put them together, the system that controls the fan, a simple transistor, burns out.\n\nThis is an easy fix: Just replace the transistor with another one that can handle more power. The problem is that this is not something that you can just get at your local electronics store. You have to know what to look for and you have to be able to find it. Luckily, I knew what to look for and I knew where to find it.\n\nThe project\n\nWe did a quick test to see if we could reduce the heat coming from the power supply by slowing down the fan. This was done using a transistor that I bought for $5. The transistor, a 2N2222, took the place of the existing transistor, a 1N4148. The 1N4148 has a limit of 150mW power draw, while the 2N2222 can handle up to 400mW.\n\nWe did the test on a completely cold system and it showed some promise. The power supply fan did slow down a little, and the unit became noticeably quieter. However, the system would become warm after a while.\n\nThen we decided to turn up the heat on the system to see if the system would slow down the fan even more. We did this by overclocking the processor. It increased the power draw from the CPU and heated up the system even more, but we were able to see a more dramatic effect. We were now able to turn the fan down to about 50 percent, and the machine was noticeably quieter.\n\nAnd what’s the cost?\n\nThe good news is that the 1N4148s are plentiful. They’re not common, but you can buy them on the Internet. One of them is going to cost you about a quarter, and if you replace all of them, it will cost you less than $2 to fix. This is a huge difference when compared to buying a new power supply for $60 or more.\n\nNow, there are a few things you should know before you do this.\n\nThe risks\n\nThe first risk is the most obvious. If you are not a tech-savvy person, you can fry the entire power supply. If you are not a competent person, you can fry the entire system. If you are not an electrical engineer, you can cause a fire and hurt someone. This is not a toy.\n\nIf you know what you’re doing and you’re careful, it’s a safe procedure. Just be smart about it.\n\nAlso, this mod is not for your office. Even though it's cheaper than a new power supply, it still costs money and you need to be careful about the dangers.\n\nThere’s one more problem that we haven’t covered, and that’s the fact that you’ll have to open up the unit. A power supply is very sensitive, and you’ll need to open up the case to get to the power supply. This can cause problems with your warranty, which could cause problems for you. This mod is for home users, not for offices.\n\nThis mod is not for your office. Even though it's cheaper than a new power supply, it still costs money and you need to be careful about the dangers.\n\nYou will also have to open up the unit, so there are some concerns about warranty. You will void the warranty if you open it up, so keep that in mind before you take this project on.\n\nTime for a fix\n\nWe have a few fixes for this problem, but we’ll only talk about two. The first one is a solution from someone named Ian over on the hardware review site bit-tech. The second one is a much cheaper solution from an enthusiast named Adam.\n\nThe Ian solution\n\nYou have to replace the 1N4148 transistor with a 2N7000, which can handle up to 700mW of power. This will cost you about $2 and you should be able to do this fix in about 10 minutes. This is the best solution that we can give you.\n\nThe Adam solution\n\nThe second fix is a little more complex and a little cheaper. This fix is a little cheaper because you’ll have to buy a chip that costs about $10. Then you have to burn the firmware for that chip. Adam actually did this and wrote a detailed article about the process. The result is an upgraded power supply that doesn’t have the problem we’re looking at.\n\nSo there you have it. You have a fix for your HP Pavilion Elite HPE-335f. It’s a cheap fix and will give you a quiet, cool computer.\n\nGood luck!
