With millions of voters still casting their ballots in the United States, presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump made last-ditch appeals Monday to people wavering between them.\n\nWith so many voters saying they are undecided, Clinton and Trump made a final effort to convince them that they are not making a wasted vote by choosing them.\n\nVoting rights have become an important issue in the campaign. In states with large minority populations, some voters complained they were still waiting for their names to be called after hours in long lines.\n\nClinton has pressed her supporters to seize on the opportunity to elect the first woman as president.\n\nShe acknowledged that not all voters are pleased with their choices.\n\n"I know you may still have questions for me. I respect that. I want to answer them. I want to earn your vote," she said.\n\n"I am reaching out to all Americans, Democrats, Republicans, independents, everyone who is as optimistic as I am, and as anxious for change as I am," she added.\n\nBut the woman she hopes to replace, President Barack Obama, asked Americans to give Clinton a chance.\n\n"The American dream is something no wall will ever contain," he said, addressing Hispanic voters.\n\nSpeaking in New Hampshire, he said, "I'm betting that tomorrow you will reject fear and choose hope."\n\nIn addition to Obama, Trump has been struggling to get support from key Republican figures.\n\nEven if he does, Trump's immediate problem is to win over the voters who backed Senator Bernie Sanders in the primaries.\n\nIn a New Hampshire rally, Sanders told supporters that he would vote for Clinton. But his endorsement came with a warning.\n\n"The major political task that we face in the next five months is to make certain that Donald Trump is defeated, and defeated badly, and I personally intend to begin my role in that process in a very short period of time," he said.\n\nEven if Trump wins the election, Sanders said, "it is incumbent upon [Trump] to tell the American people that he will listen to them and their needs."\n\nWhile Sanders spoke, protesters from the group Code Pink interrupted his speech, but were quickly escorted out.\n\nSome Republicans also said they are not going to vote for Trump. The campaign of Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte said she would not vote for either Trump or Clinton. Ayotte is locked in a tight race in New Hampshire against a Democrat.\n\nMeanwhile, FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to lawmakers on Sunday, informing them that investigators had discovered emails that "appear to be pertinent" to an earlier probe of Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.\n\nComey said that the FBI is taking steps to determine whether the newly discovered emails "contain classified information."\n\nVoters were still heading to the polls in many states on Monday, including Virginia, Indiana, South Carolina and Georgia.\n\nEarly voting also continues in states such as Illinois, Texas, Florida, Arizona and California.\n\nIn Texas, a federal judge blocked a Texas law that would require voters to show identification before they can cast a ballot. The ruling was a victory for the Obama administration and voting rights activists, who argued the law was discriminatory against Hispanics and other minorities.\n\nRepublican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton promised an immediate appeal of the ruling, saying "the integrity of the voting process is at stake."\n\nAt a news conference Monday morning, Trump said his rival's "under-handed tactics" could cost her victory in the presidential election.\n\nClinton's campaign said it is "pleased" the court "voted to reject efforts to disenfranchise [people of color] and women."\n\nWith a record number of Americans registering to vote, officials are expecting a record turnout of more than 130 million ballots.\n\n\n\nThe race for the White House is also close in states considered to be battlegrounds, which have enough electoral votes to potentially swing the election. Polls suggest that they are too close to call.\n\nVoters on the eastern U.S. seaboard will be among the last to cast their ballots.\n\nPolling shows Clinton is maintaining her lead in the traditional battleground state of Florida. She is also holding on to a slim lead in North Carolina"
