Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has arrived in London to receive medical treatment.\n\nThe leader is expected to stay for up to three weeks, although he will still hold cabinet meetings in Abuja.\n\nPresident Buhari, 75, travelled to London for an undisclosed ailment on 11 May.\n\nHe returned to Nigeria on 28 May for a summit with Chad's President Idriss Deby Itno, where he declared himself "fit as a fiddle".\n\nHowever, his health was described as "not very good" by his personal physician, Olanrewaju Suraj, during a BBC interview the following day.\n\nA statement on the president's official Twitter account said he will be undergoing medical treatment in the UK.\n\nPresident Buhari was elected in 2015 after defeating incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nNigeria, which is Africa's most populous nation, has suffered several Islamist insurgencies in the past few years.\n\nIn 2015, President Buhari declared a state of emergency in the northeast states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa to fight Boko Haram.\n\nThe Islamist group has killed 15,000 people and displaced more than two million in Nigeria since 2009.\n\nPresident Buhari's first overseas trip since his 2015 election was to the UK, which he chose as his first international visit as president.\n\nHe also had talks with former Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\nIn February this year, the UK government announced Â£75m ($100m) of funding for security in Nigeria, to go towards training the country's military and police forces to fight against Boko Haram and other extremist groups.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May said at the time that UK forces were "playing a leading role in training Nigerian forces to defeat Boko Haram".
