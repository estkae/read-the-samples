Christina\n\nThis dress was absolutely beautiful!! It was so comfortable and fit me perfectly. I only had to make some minor alterations. I could not believe that I was able to order this dress and have it shipped to me within 2 weeks. I was in awe! Everything came out just as I had hoped. I couldn't have asked for anything better. I ordered from another online store before and was sent the wrong color dress, size and they didn't have the top I had requested. I was not able to get a refund or another top. I was so worried about ordering another dress online but I am glad that I did! The quality of the dress was amazing. I was so impressed with this company and will continue to use them in the future.
