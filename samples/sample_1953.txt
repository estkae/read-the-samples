"| Street View\n\nThe Victory Theatre was opened in 1920. It was located in downtown North Adams, MA in the most prestigious block in the city. It was a 1300 seat theatre. A night in the Victory Theatre was a popular event. Comedians like Henny Youngman, Red Buttons, Eddie Albert, and Milton Berle headlined many shows. There were also classical music concerts with performers like Lawrence Tibbett, Jose Iturbi and Pablo Casals. It was also used for the occasional play and movie premiere.\n\nThe Victory Theatre closed in 1965. It was converted into a movie theater in 1965, but went dark in 1966. In 1967 it was remodeled as a furniture store, and in 1973 it became a Salvation Army.\n\nContributed by Lost Memory
