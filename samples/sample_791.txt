Conan O’Brien is taking a stand against a California bill that would require porn stars to use condoms.\n\nThe proposal is currently in committee at the state legislature, but O’Brien has joined the ranks of the adult entertainment industry to oppose the bill.\n\n“As the founder of Team Coco, I believe that it is important to support Team Porn,” O’Brien said in a statement, adding that the condom-mandate would “impose on actors and viewers an extra layer of non-sexy bureaucracy.”\n\nO’Brien signed his name to a letter (obtained by the Los Angeles Times) opposing the bill that was signed by dozens of adult entertainment performers, including a number of porn stars.\n\n“Porn is an adult product, and when consumed, it should be consumed by adults who have the option to do so with or without a condom,” the letter reads. “We believe that the use of condoms in adult videos is an element of the production that is intended to be viewed by adults and not by children. It is our belief that imposing condom use in adult films would result in an increase in the number of people viewing adult films online.”\n\nAccording to the porn stars’ letter, “porn performers are more likely to be exposed to STIs than other workers” and they are tested regularly. The letter argues that there is no evidence that porn stars are exposed to a greater risk of HIV/AIDS than people in other industries and that the number of performers diagnosed with HIV or AIDS has been extremely low.\n\n“Our industry has been a model for safe sex in the workplace since its inception in the early 1970s,” the letter continues. “However, we feel that adding another layer of bureaucracy to our industry would be a disservice to our business, and the people who work in it.”\n\nThe bill, introduced by Assemblywoman Isadore Hall (D-Compton), would impose the condom mandate on all porn actors in the state of California. Violators would be fined up to $1,000 and could have their film licenses suspended or revoked.\n\n“While pornography is protected under the First Amendment, the adult film industry is subject to occupational safety and health standards like every other industry in the state,” Hall said in a statement. “[This bill] will help protect adult film performers from contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.”\n\nA spokesman for O’Brien declined to say whether or not the comedian, who hosted the MTV Music Awards on Sunday, will appear in a condom ad in California.
