"If we saw that same result among heterosexuals, everyone would be surprised, because we tend to think of heterosexual sex as normative and everybody kind of expects that."\n\nThe study was based on findings from two national surveys of American adults, conducted in 1990-91 and in 2008-10, respectively.\n\nThe findings also held true in a subsequent analysis that included men and women.\n\n"[I]f they felt satisfied with their relationship, they were having sex just as often as heterosexuals," Schilt said, according to the article.\n\nA 2011 study found that lesbian relationships tended to be more satisfying for the women involved than their male-female counterparts, although gay male relationships tended to be more satisfying for the men, the article reported.
