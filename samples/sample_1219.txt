It has nothing to do with luck or a sudden viral boost. It’s about the value you provide.\n\nDoes a 10-second “like” video posted on Facebook with a cute kitten or puppy do the trick? Maybe not.\n\nDo a “how to” video that’s actually useful? That’s much more likely to do the trick.\n\nThat’s because people like value. When you’re creating content, it’s always a good idea to remember that your audience wants to get something out of it. That’s the only way to make sure that your content performs well.\n\nIn this article, I’m going to tell you how you can make sure that your videos get attention and views. This article is going to be a practical guide for you to understand what it takes to make a video go viral.\n\nIf you’ve been disappointed by some of your previous video campaigns, this is an article that will help you take your video marketing to the next level.\n\nWhat Makes a Video Viral?\n\nWhy do certain videos go viral while others don’t? What makes a video worth sharing and commenting on? There are several characteristics of a video that influence its virality.\n\n#1 – Simplicity\n\nHave you noticed how most viral videos on the internet are short? This is because they’re simple. There are no complicated ideas or messages.\n\nSimple videos are also easier to understand and easier to share with others. So it should come as no surprise that when you’re creating your video, you should keep things simple.\n\nMost people don’t have the time or interest to watch a long and boring video, so keep things short and sweet. If you’re creating a video for your marketing campaign, focus on the points you want to make. Avoid too much blabber.\n\nIf you’re planning to make a “behind the scenes” video, you can also use your camera to take pictures. There are apps that can take photos and turn them into a video, so that’s something you should try out.\n\nFor example, one of my clients has created videos that are only a few seconds long, with quick and easy tips. Here’s an example:\n\nThe videos are meant to be posted on social media, and they’re extremely popular.\n\n#2 – Specificity\n\nYour video should be focused on a single subject. When it comes to creating videos for marketing, try to have a clear idea of what you want to talk about.\n\nFor example, if you’re planning to make a video about your new product, focus on it. Don’t talk about too many different things, or people will get confused.\n\nIt’s also a good idea to give a specific name to your video. As strange as it may seem, many people who upload a video to YouTube or Facebook often forget to give it a name.\n\nA good video title should be short and catchy. Remember that when it comes to viral content, the name is often what’s going to be used for sharing. So make it as easy as possible to share.\n\nYou can also create a great title by putting a keyword that matches your video in the title. For example, if you’re talking about your new product, you can use the name of your product as the title.\n\n#3 – Originality\n\nIf you’re doing a marketing video, you’re not the only one who’s going to be doing marketing videos. So you have to make sure that your video stands out from the crowd.\n\nThe easiest way to do that is to be original. Instead of taking the easy route and making a video that shows your product or a behind the scenes look, try something different.\n\nYou could create a video that shows how you started the company or a video that shows the reason why you started your company in the first place.\n\nThe bottom line is that you have to make sure that your video is different from the rest of the videos out there. If you do, your video is going to get a lot more attention.\n\n#4 – Entertainment Value\n\nAnother characteristic of viral content is entertainment value. You don’t have to create a funny video to have fun content, but it helps.\n\nThe most successful viral videos are often funny. This is why many companies create video ads that have an entertaining touch to them.\n\nFor example, Oreo recently made a video ad with people eating cookies in many different ways. The video was entertaining, and it went viral very fast.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NExiZm1eE0s\n\n#5 – Attention Grabbing Content\n\nAnother reason why videos go viral is that they have something interesting to look at. You can’t expect people to look at your video if there’s nothing interesting going on.\n\nIn other words, your video needs to be visually appealing.\n\nPeople want to see interesting things, so if you can add some unusual content to your video, you will have a better chance of people noticing it.\n\nIf you’re creating a video for a marketing campaign, try to have a look that is going to make it stand out from the rest. It can be a new and original design, or a catchy headline.\n\nWhatever you decide to do, make sure that it’s something that grabs the attention. People don’t have time to waste on your videos, so if you want to get views, you have to make sure that you provide something worth seeing.\n\n#6 – Shareability\n\nWhen you’re creating your video, it’s a good idea to keep in mind that people share videos on social media.\n\nVideos are very shareable, so you should try to make something that’s going to be easy to share. You can do this by creating a video that is easy to understand.\n\nA good way to make sure that your video is going to be easy to share is to make it short and clear. Avoid too much blabber and unnecessary details.\n\nFor example, you could have a picture at the beginning of the video that explains what the video is all about. Then, you can show a few short clips and talk about it.\n\nMake your video as clear as possible, and people will find it easy to share it.\n\n#7 – Longer Video\n\nIf you’ve read the previous points, you might have noticed that I didn’t recommend that you create a long video. This is because, contrary to popular belief, a long video can actually be more effective.\n\nYou have to keep in mind that when people are watching your video, they’re not going to watch it all the way to the end if they don’t find it interesting.\n\nSo it’s a good idea to keep it short. However, that doesn’t mean that you can’t create a long video if you want to.\n\nThere are many long videos that have gone viral, such as one of my favorite videos:\n\nThis video is 2 hours and 41 minutes long, and it has had over 500 million views. And it’s not just a single video, there are many other videos in this series that have also gone viral.\n\nSo you can’t say that long videos don’t go viral.\n\nThe bottom line is that there are no rules. The type of video that is going to work best for you will depend on the type of audience you’re trying to reach.\n\nSo if you want to create a long video, do it. And if you want to create a short video, do it. Just make sure that you’re providing something worth watching.\n\nAre You Ready to Create Your Video?\n\nNow that you know how to create videos that are going to go viral, it’s time to get started.\n\nThere are many video creation tools that you can use, and I’ve written an article about them.\n\nHowever, you should keep in mind that it’s always a good idea to create videos with a computer.\n\nIf you want to create videos that are going to go viral, you need to do it right. And you can’t do it right if you’re working with a cell phone or a tablet.\n\nIf you’re serious about going viral with your videos, you need to invest in a good camera. If you can’t afford one, then you can always rent one.\n\nIt’s also a good idea to learn how to use your camera properly. So if you’re a beginner, you should start by learning how to use it.\n\nMost camera manuals contain a lot of information, and they can teach you a lot about the device. You can also use a tutorial video on YouTube, or you can ask a professional to help you out.\n\nDon’t try to learn everything by yourself, or you’ll end up getting frustrated and not creating anything. And if you want to learn how to create videos that are going to go viral, you have to create something.\n\nSo use the advice I’ve given you in this article to get started.\n\nP.S
