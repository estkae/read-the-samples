Frank Artiles resigned from his seat after the South Florida political community expressed outrage over his conduct.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Artiles cited the “harmful and embarrassing distractions” his presence would cause his fellow senators, his constituents and the people of Florida. The resignation is effective at midnight.\n\nBut Artiles’ tenure in the Florida Senate wasn’t going to last much longer anyway.\n\nAfter his racist and sexist remarks to two African-American senators were made public on Wednesday, he was facing expulsion proceedings from the Florida Senate.\n\nA little more than 24 hours later, he was gone.\n\n“This was not an easy decision to make, but I do believe it is in the best interest of my constituents,” Artiles said in his resignation letter. “I apologize to my family, friends and most importantly to my constituents.”\n\nMore: Sen.

Jack Latvala of Clearwater, filed a resolution Wednesday night to begin proceedings.\n\nLatvala's resolution said Artiles “used offensive, racist and disrespectful language” during an exchange on the Senate floor with fellow Democratic Sen. Audrey Gibson of Jacksonville and Democratic Sen. Perry Thurston of Fort Lauderdale.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday night, Senate President Joe Negron, R-Stuart, said he was “appalled” by Artiles’ comments and said Artiles will publicly apologize to Gibson and Thurston on the Senate floor Thursday morning.\n\nCLOSE State Sen. Frank Artiles explains why he apologized on the Florida Senate floor Wednesday, April 19, 2017.\n\n“Racial slurs and profane, sexist insults have no place in conversation between Senators and will not be tolerated while I am serving as Senate President,” Negron said. “Senator Artiles has requested a Senate apology. I understand his decision to resign and appreciate his willingness to do the right thing.”\n\nLater, Negron released a statement saying Artiles has resigned.\n\nLatvala said in a brief interview Thursday that the chamber was expected to approve his resolution on a “voice vote” — with the expectation that Artiles would be expelled.\n\n“The public expected us to take action, and I was going to be the one who was going to do it,” Latvala said.\n\nBut he said the resignation was an unexpected turn of events. “It’s amazing,” he said.\n\nLatvala said Artiles’ Republican colleagues would have been happy to expel Artiles, but he added, “I don’t think that was his goal, or I don’t think he expected it.”\n\nLatvala also criticized the Senate Democratic caucus for not publicly demanding Artiles’ resignation. He said he wasn’t sure whether the chamber would have expelled Artiles had he not resigned.\n\n“We would have done something,” he said.\n\nLatvala said Artiles’ resignation means the Senate will hold a “lame-duck” session in which he will be able to collect a paycheck for about two more months.\n\n“It’s the taxpayers’ money,”"
