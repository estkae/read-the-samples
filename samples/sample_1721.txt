\n\nDana White believes the UFC could pull in a $500 million sale price. (L.E. Baskow/AP)\n\nMMA fans were taken aback Wednesday when reports surfaced that the Ultimate Fighting Championship was close to a sale to talent agency WME-IMG for $4 billion. Now, UFC president Dana White has confirmed the news.\n\n“It’s a crazy, crazy deal,” White told Fox Sports Live on Wednesday night. “It’s gonna bring a lot of equity into the company. It’s gonna bring a lot of cash, obviously. The legacy of this thing is big, big, big. This is going to be a great thing for this sport and for this company.”\n\nThe deal, which is still pending approval by the UFC’s owners, will make WME-IMG the majority owner of the UFC, with the promotion’s current owner, the Fertitta family, retaining a minority stake in the company. It will be the second-largest deal in sports history behind WME-IMG’s acquisition of Professional Bull Riders in January for $100 million.\n\nWME-IMG is the same talent agency that represents UFC stars such as Ronda Rousey, Conor McGregor and Jon Jones. White will stay on as president of the UFC, which will remain in its current headquarters in Las Vegas.\n\n“They’ve done a great job with a lot of companies,” White said of WME-IMG. “A lot of the other companies they’ve bought are smaller than this. But this is going to be great for our sport.”\n\nThe UFC has struggled financially in the past year as it moved from a pay-per-view model to a television package. The UFC is currently in the second year of a seven-year deal with Fox that allows it to showcase five fight cards on broadcast television as well as four pay-per-view cards annually.\n\nThe UFC expects to put on more than 40 shows in 2016, which would make it a busier schedule than any year in its history.\n\n“Our new partnership with WME-IMG will provide the UFC with strategic growth opportunities,” White said in a statement. “Our new ownership group is the perfect fit for the UFC and will open doors to take this sport to the next level.”
