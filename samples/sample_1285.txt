Józef Maria Hoene-Wroński\n\nJózef Maria Hoene-Wroński (; 10 April 1884 – 23 November 1939) was a Polish philosopher, logician, philosopher of science and a mathematician. He was one of the most influential thinkers in the interwar Poland. He was also a major exponent of Thomism in Poland. Hoene-Wroński is widely regarded as the most prominent and original philosopher of the early 20th century in Poland. He authored several dozen books, mostly in the Polish language, but also some in French, and others in German and English.\n\nHoene-Wroński's work has been cited as an inspiration by many prominent philosophers including Stanisław Leśniewski, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, and Andrzej Mostowski. As a result, the concepts developed by Hoene-Wroński continue to be taught at the Universities of Warsaw, Poznań, and Lublin, as well as the Catholic University of Lublin, and in philosophy departments of the Society of Jesus in Poland. The study of Hoene-Wroński's philosophy and logical work in Poland and abroad is based at the Center for the Study of the Philosophy of Jozef Maria Hoene-Wroński, which is affiliated with the Society of Jesus.\n\nHoene-Wroński was born on 10 April 1884 in Czerniowce, then in the Stanisławów Voivodeship in the south-east of the partitioned Poland, under the rule of the Russian Empire. He was the oldest child of Tomasz Hoene-Wroński (1852-1929), a local magistrate, and his wife, Ludwika née Bartnik (1857-1917). Hoene-Wroński was the fourth child of the family, which also included three sisters, all of whom died during World War II. One of the sisters, Bronisława (1885-1887) died of tuberculosis at the age of 2, while Maria (1888-1890) died of the same illness at the age of 2, and the youngest, Bronisława (1892-1943), was killed during World War II.\n\nAfter graduating from the elementary school in Czerniowce, Hoene-Wroński moved to Lviv in 1900. He graduated from a classical gymnasium in 1903. In 1904, he enrolled in the Philosophy Department of the University of Lviv, where he began his studies under Kazimierz Twardowski, an eminent logician and philosopher. Later, he studied under another notable philosopher, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, the founder of the Lwów–Warsaw School of logic and a proponent of the contemporary logic of Russell and Whitehead. Hoene-Wroński also studied mathematics, obtaining the title of a "magister of mathematics" in 1907. In 1910, he earned his doctoral degree in philosophy, and became a professor in the University of Lwów, the most prestigious academic institution in interwar Poland.\n\nIn 1912, Hoene-Wroński married his cousin, Antonina Krystyna (née Brzozowska; 1885–1949), and had five children. His oldest son, Władysław (1913–1997) was the founder of the Lublin-based "Państwowy Instytut Geologiczny" (State Geological Institute). His second son, Tadeusz (1917–1999) was a doctor of medicine and the founder of the University of Łód"
