"The $5.1 billion Formula 1 circuit that has divided Miami-Dade’s political elite for years is not dead yet.\n\nA lawsuit against the property’s developer, California billionaire Tilman Fertitta, and the City of Homestead will be heard by an appellate court later this year.\n\nThough a judge earlier this year ruled the property must remain as a speedway until the suit is resolved, developer Fertitta and the City of Homestead say the judgment was made in error and they’re pushing back.\n\n“This has been one of the most complicated and complicated transactions in all of Miami-Dade County,” Homestead Mayor Jeff Porter said. “But it will be an even bigger deal to win on appeal.”\n\nRelated story: Developer plans major changes to Miami Formula 1 track\n\nDeveloper Fertitta and city officials say they are planning a major overhaul of the circuit and want to redevelop some of the land as shops and restaurants.\n\n“It would be a shame if we had to kill the golden goose because some activist attorney out there wants to force us to do something we don’t want to do,” Fertitta said.\n\nOpponents of the circuit, however, say the appeal is just a step in Fertitta’s plan to keep the track from reopening.\n\n“They’ve spent more money to keep it closed than the value of the property is,” said Michael Anderson, a former Homestead City Council member. “They just keep filing motions and filing motions. It’s absurd.”\n\nThe circuit was built with great fanfare in 2009, but ran for just two seasons and closed in 2011. The recession and a worldwide slump in racing attendance hurt the circuit. It also faced stiff competition from the $4.6 billion Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas.\n\nRelated story: Report: Miami F1 track in $100 million hole\n\nThough the circuit never made money, city officials say it will still be economically beneficial.\n\n“The track will open,” said Homestead Mayor Jeff Porter. “I’ve been very public on this. The question is what’s the best use of the property. And the best use is for a motorsports park.”\n\nThe circuit had several potential uses. It was discussed as a possible casino site and would also have made a good venue for large-scale entertainment concerts. But Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez and a handful of local lawmakers wanted it to become an international auto racing track.\n\nThe county agreed to buy the property for $13.1 million to give Fertitta control over the facility.\n\nRelated story: Miami racetrack too costly to operate: F1\n\nLast year, Fertitta filed for bankruptcy, claiming the property was costing him too much money to maintain. The bankruptcy filing put a halt to the foreclosure process that was started by a lender, Kowaliga Country Club, after it claimed Fertitta failed to make good on a $13.5 million loan. The foreclosure process was halted when a judge issued a temporary restraining order against Fertitta.\n\nJudge Michael Moore ruled that the property must be held as a racetrack until the bankruptcy proceedings are concluded. That could take years, since Fertitta and Homestead have said they plan to appeal the judge’s decision.
