Less than a week after Arnold Schwarzenegger acknowledged that he fathered a child more than a decade ago, Maria Shriver and the couple’s four children are planning to attend the next few public events in the former governor’s schedule, CNN has confirmed.\n\nThe appearances will include the 6 p.m. ET Tuesday premiere of Schwarzenegger’s new documentary at the South By Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. Shriver, her children, and Schwarzenegger’s children are expected to be in the audience.\n\nOn Thursday, the actor is scheduled to speak at the Arnold Sports Festival in Columbus, Ohio, where he’ll receive the Lifetime Achievement Award. Shriver and the children are expected to be in the audience for that event as well, CNN has learned.\n\nThere are no plans for Shriver to accompany Schwarzenegger on a trip to Chicago later this month for the Radio & Television Congressional Correspondents dinner.\n\nMeanwhile, the cable news channel’s sources say Shriver and the family are not attending Sunday’s Academy Awards ceremony.\n\nDuring a statement released late last week, the former California governor apologized to his wife and children. “I am deeply sorry for the pain I have caused Maria and our children,” he said. “I am truly sorry.”\n\n“I have behaved badly sometimes,” he said. “I have done things I thought I should not have done, and I regret it, and I apologize for it.”
