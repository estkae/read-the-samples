\n\n"Brain Quest - Hard at Work" is the latest addition to the "Brain Quest" series of educational games. This is the first game in the series that takes on subjects that the majority of adults would find extremely challenging. Questions in the game are based on adult topics that are really hard to answer such as IT terms, drug related trivia and much more. It is also the first game in the series to not be based on the national curriculum as the questions in this game are based on the adult knowledge you will have acquired in your life.\n\n\n\nThe game is all about challenge and with that it is meant for adults and older kids. The game starts out with a difficulty meter which will indicate whether the player is ready for the game or not. The game is broken down into three different parts with the first being a sort of trivia. The questions come in a random order and it is up to the player to answer them. The questions are not like the ones you might have seen in the national curriculum tests where there is always one correct answer. There can be multiple answers to a question and there can even be multiple questions that are related to the same topic.\n\n\n\nThe second part of the game is the quiz. The questions come in a random order and once again it is up to the player to answer them. For every question answered correctly, the player is awarded points. The game is split into 3 rounds. At the end of the round the player gets a break which is indicated by a green banner. The green banner also indicates that the player is on the right track. The more rounds the player passes, the harder the questions get.\n\n\n\nThe last part of the game is the "Speed Round". The questions here come in a random order and once again it is up to the player to answer them. The player gets 60 seconds to answer the questions. The green banner that indicated the player is doing well is replaced with a red banner that indicates that the player is running out of time. For every question answered correctly, the player is awarded points.\n\n\n\nThis game is all about challenge and the player needs to accept that and not get frustrated with it. Getting the right answer to the question is more important than how long it takes to answer it.\n\n\n\nThe graphics in the game are what we are used to seeing in other "Brain Quest" games and as usual, they are high quality. The sound is great and adds to the overall atmosphere of the game.\n\n\n\nThis game is all about challenge and it is meant for adults and older kids. This is a game for the thinking adults who would like to have a bit of fun by testing their knowledge.\n\n\n\nTitle: Brain Quest - Hard at Work\n\nDeveloper: "All in Play Inc"\n\nGenre: Board Game/Quiz\n\nPlayers: 1\n\nMemory Blocks: 128KB (32 Blocks)\n\nFree Play: Yes\n\nJoystick: Interface 2\n\nSkill Levels: 3\n\nReviewer: Chris Gill\n\n\n\nGraphics\n\nPlayability\n\nLastability\n\nOverall\n\nN/A53%45%52%50%\n\nIf you are the kind of person that likes to test your knowledge in front of others then this game is perfect for you.
