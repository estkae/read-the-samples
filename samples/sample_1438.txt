"Back in February 2017, right before Super Bowl 51, Adweek shared that the Atlanta Falcons would not have a single ad during the game. This is particularly odd because not only did they win the game, but they were defending the NFC title. It’s a pretty easy chance to get noticed and generate some buzz.\n\nWell, that ended up being a really poor decision. Not only did they not get much media attention or press, but they didn’t even have a presence at the event. It was all the Patriots that night.\n\nThis is just one example of many where good marketers can lose a ton of exposure because they don’t know how to market well.\n\nLuckily, you can learn from these mistakes. Today, I’ll share the four most common marketing mistakes NFL teams make and how you can avoid them.\n\nThey Spend Too Much Time on Developing the Perfect Strategy\n\nThe perfect marketing strategy can take weeks to put together. Sometimes even months. Teams have to come up with their own unique way of expressing their story, which is no easy task.\n\nBut it doesn’t have to be.\n\nYou need to start simple. At least at first. Do your research and develop a plan that you can execute right away. Then, from there, you can learn from your first experiences and develop new ways to share your story over time.\n\nA lot of times, teams don’t get a chance to do that. They lose all their momentum because they waited too long.\n\nThey Use the Same Strategy Every Year\n\nOne of the worst things you can do as a marketer is use the same strategy over and over again. Every year, we have new teams and new opportunities. It’s really important that you adjust your marketing strategy based on what works and what doesn’t.\n\nRemember that we don’t have to reinvent the wheel. But if you’re using the same methods, you’re not giving yourself enough opportunities to stand out.\n\nThey Focus Too Much on Strategy Instead of Execution\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes I see in NFL marketing is that people get so caught up in coming up with the perfect strategy that they never actually put any of their ideas into action. They get caught up in the strategy stage and don’t execute their plans.\n\nBut we can’t do that.\n\nYou have to focus on execution. This is the part where you actually get out there and do the work. This is where you move from theory to reality. When you only focus on strategy, you miss out on valuable time to make your brand more successful.\n\nThey Fail to Monitor Progress\n\nA common problem with NFL teams is that they don’t measure the impact of their marketing efforts. They don’t keep track of the things that are working and the things that are not.\n\nYou have to be able to monitor your progress. What kind of feedback are you getting? What kind of exposure are you getting? If you don’t know what’s working, then you’re going to struggle to improve in the future.\n\nThis is where the data comes in. It’s important to be able to measure your success so you can adjust accordingly.\n\nDon’t let the NFL be a fool. Don’t make these same mistakes.\n\nAvoid the following common mistakes that NFL teams make and you’ll be off to a great start.\n\nQuestions?\n\nLet me know your questions about sports marketing in the comments below.
