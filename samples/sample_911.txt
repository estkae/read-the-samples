Movies can help us understand history in a very personal way. (We don’t mean “They are filming a movie about it”—we mean “They filmed that movie during that period”.)\n\n\n\nIn this week’s episode, we discuss two such films: Ulysses (1954), based on James Joyce’s classic novel, and Alexander the Great (1956), with Richard Burton as the Macedonian king.\n\nWe also consider what was happening in the world around these films, particularly in the politics of the post-World War II era.\n\nIf you have feedback or questions, we would love to hear from you! Email us at mail@shadowsidesradio.com.\n\nAlso, you can subscribe to the podcast for free via iTunes or Stitcher.\n\nAnd, if you’re enjoying our show, please consider supporting us through Patreon.\n\n\n\n\n\n
