This addon is no longer being supported, and has been disabled. The coding style has changed drastically over time, and there's no way I can go back and update it. It still functions, but is a bit of a mess.\n\nDescription\n\nUsing the default Blizzard buff frames (Power and Deadly Boss Mods timers) are pretty, but they're very minimal. That's where BigWigs comes in. BigWigs is an add-on that improves upon the default buffing interface, allowing you to easily keep track of your debuffs and cooldowns with the use of individual display boxes, among other features.\n\nWith BigWigs, you can easily keep track of the status of multiple buffs at the same time, as well as keeping an eye on your debuffs. It can track spell casts on you, both in and out of combat."
