"I was very lucky to get to spend a week in a beautiful loft with a wonderful view and in an area with lots of great restaurants and things to do. This is the perfect location if you're visiting the city of Brussels and surrounding areas. Getting into the city was very easy and was a 10 minute car drive. Both my girlfriend and I enjoyed our stay and would stay again if we return. Thanks Rob and Cecile for your hospitality. I would recommend staying here to any couple who are looking for a nice, relaxing stay in Brussels.
