Charles Monroe-Kane is fascinated with cockroaches. Now, there's a big theme.\n\n\n\nMonroe-Kane's show at the Linda Hodges Gallery, titled "Cockroach", features thirteen pieces that feature his favored theme. It may be an unusual choice of subject, but then again, artists have often been drawn to the taboo or the forbidden or the socially unacceptable.\n\n\n\nIn most of these pieces Monroe-Kane depicts, either alone or in various groups, roaches in a variety of settings. One of his works, titled "The Cockroach Hike", consists of a lone cockroach walking across a granite boulder. The rock is set in an ethereal mist that obscures its exact location, but somehow I suspect it's not in California. It's a stunning piece.\n\n\n\nOne of my favorite works in this show, titled "The Dead Roach Walking", shows a dead cockroach standing up, covered in a sparkling coating of gold paint. It's as if it had been so dead for so long that it was actually turned to gold. The title comes from the Elvis Presley song of the same name. The roach, painted gold, is wearing Elvis's famous white sequin jumpsuit. The letters "CELEBRITY" adorn the creature's abdomen. This is a truly macabre yet"
