I heard at least five,” said Elijah Rodriguez, 17, who works near the shooting scene.\n\nIn the chaos of the moment, a woman, also described as being in her 30s, and a man, were wounded as bystanders rushed to escape the gunfire, Johnson said.\n\nAn officer who arrived at the scene was shot in the head at point blank range, but his vest saved his life, Johnson said.\n\n(click for source)
