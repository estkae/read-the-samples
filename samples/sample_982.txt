"Good location, bad hotel."\n\nRoom was freezing at night, even after asking reception to turn the temperature up and open the windows. Food was pretty much inedible, I didn't even bother trying breakfast. And it's a really far walk into the center of Krakow. Luckily we had a car so that was no problem, but still.\n\nTraveller from Canada
