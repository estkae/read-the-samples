Like every season, he joins the elite squad of champions who have reached all four major finals and achieved victories in three of them, equal with the great Rod Laver.\n\nNadal also reached all the finals of the Grand Slams, in which he has already been able to win 10 titles.\n\nThe 31-year-old left-hander played a flawless game against a rival who is no longer at the top of his level, but he is nevertheless the best clay player in the world and has reached the final after a very short and clean game with no errors.\n\nAs with every one of the 17 titles he has won on the red dirt of Roland Garros, the world no. 2 is going to drink champagne for his 18th career trophy.\n\nWith this performance, Rafa Nadal has confirmed that he is still the best clay player in the world, even if Roger Federer is doing the same on hard.\n\nBy the way, how can we forget that he has more Roland Garros trophies than his archrival?\n\nAs for the rest of the draw, Marin Cilic was pushed to a double against Diego Schwartzman, who gave the Croat a scare in the first set, and the US Open champion escaped from that game in which the Argentinian player could have even obtained an unlikely victory.\n\nKaren Khachanov was very solid, losing only a game to Hyeon Chung, the player who gave Roger Federer one of his biggest defeats"
