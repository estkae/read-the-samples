PARIS - France will sign up to a second tranche of economic aid to Greece, a source close to the negotiations said Tuesday, bringing the total sum of bailouts to 240 billion euros ($268 billion).\n\nThe total, which has been kept under wraps to avoid provoking popular anger ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections in the eurozone country, was confirmed by a government source.\n\nFinance minister Michel Sapin confirmed France's intention to contribute to the next tranche, but stopped short of saying how much, adding it would be "a good deal less than the first one."\n\nGreece needs to find fresh sources of financing to get through the rest of the year and into 2014, after the first aid package of 240 billion euros came to an end in March, with the eurozone still smarting from the damage done to confidence by the country's debt crisis.\n\nThe government in Athens has said it wants the country to stay in the eurozone and that its target for 2014 is to achieve a primary budget surplus - which excludes interest payments - of 1.5 percent of gross domestic product.\n\n"There's no doubt that we will respect the target," Sapin said. "It's hard, but it's absolutely necessary."\n\nSapin said he wanted "as soon as possible" for negotiations to begin with Greece on the new tranche of aid.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde said in Washington that negotiations on a new loan to Greece will begin in the "coming weeks."\n\nSapin said the final sum of the second tranche would be known by July.\n\nFrance, a key contributor to the first rescue plan for Greece, will be asked to contribute its share once again. But President Francois Hollande has made clear he will not sign off on any further money until there is a European banking union, and until European Union rules are modified to enable the European Central Bank to buy sovereign bonds.\n\n"The more Europe integrates, the more the eurozone integrates, the more each country will contribute in proportion to its financial weight and its size. This is the principle of solidarity," Sapin said.\n\n"And this is why we can no longer accept this situation that in times of difficulty the country with the most difficulties has to do it all alone.\
