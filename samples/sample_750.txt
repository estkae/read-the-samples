"I was searching the internet for a cheap way to create large water features. All I could find was the stock pond kits at Walmart. These kits are $400 and take up an awful lot of space for a smallish pond. I was looking for a cheaper alternative and I found it on this site. I ordered the Basic Fountain kit and I love it. It came with all the instructions to put it together and the necessary materials. I was a little nervous when I saw it, it seemed kind of flimsy, but after reading the instructions a few times, I went to town and put it together. It took me about 2 hours and then it was ready for water. The directions are easy to follow. I highly recommend this kit to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive way to create a water feature.
