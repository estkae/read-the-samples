Ankara: Syria has moved chemical weapons to its largest city, amid international concerns about a possible American-led strike in response to a suspected chemical attack that killed hundreds in Damascus.\n\nForeign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said in an interview with state-run TRT television on Monday that there are "concrete" signs of the movement of Syria's chemical weapons stocks and that he expects more information about their locations to emerge. He said Turkey was sharing this information with allied countries and the international community.\n\nMr Davutoglu didn't say where the weapons are allegedly being moved, or give any indication of how Turkey's allies would respond to the news.\n\nTurkey is a staunch opponent of the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and hosts more than 120,000 Syrian refugees on its territory.\n\nMr Davutoglu also said the Turkish parliament will vote on a request to allow Turkish troops to go to foreign countries, including Syria. Parliament is expected to approve the request when it convenes later on Monday.\n\nUS officials have said they are preparing possible military action against Syria after accusing the Assad government of launching a chemical attack on its own people last week that killed hundreds of civilians, including children.\n\nTurkey has a 900km border with Syria.\n\nMr Davutoglu warned that any military action against Syria must not violate international law.\n\n"We are disturbed by the possibility of a unilateral military operation outside the UN framework," he said.\n\nTurkey is a member of NATO, which has vowed to support a member state under attack, but hasn't said whether that support would be military.\n\nMr Davutoglu said the Turkish parliament will vote on whether to allow Turkish troops to go into Syria if international forces led by the US launch a military operation there.\n\n"We are not thinking about the issue of war," he said.\n\n"In the event of a threat to Turkey or a Turkish citizen, Turkey will take all measures and the necessary steps to ensure its own security," he said.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Syria's ally Russia said the chemical attack last week appeared to be a provocation.\n\nForeign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in Moscow that the attack would have been impossible to carry out without a "powerful external assistance."\n\nHe accused the US and its allies of attempting to use the attack as a justification for military action against the Assad regime.\n\nThe US ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, told the Security Council that the world cannot wait for a diplomatic solution to the Syrian crisis, saying that the international community is speaking with one voice on the need for a military response.\n\n"Failing to respond to this outrageous attack would increase the risk of more attacks," she said. "Bashar al-Assad must know that he will be held accountable for the use of chemical weapons and that the rest of the world will be watching."\n\nMs Power also challenged Syria's claim that the rebels were responsible for the attack, saying there is "no question that an atrocity occurred."\n\nThe president of the council, Brazilian Ambassador Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti, said the council will "start a more in-depth study" of the situation in Syria on Tuesday.\n\nAP
