I bought a Groupon for this place and had the same mixed experience as the previous review. There was confusion at the desk over whether or not I was scheduled. Then I was scheduled next door and didn't get the Groupon discount I was promised. I tried to correct the problem, but the staff seemed to be confused as to who was supposed to be helping me. So my treatment ended up costing quite a bit more than it should have, and I was very disappointed. I guess you get what you pay for.
