June 7, 2011 at 3:26 PM\n\nA jury in Kent convicted a woman of robbery and theft Monday afternoon for a crime that could put her in prison for a long time.\n\nMegan Lee Hunter, 31, was found guilty of second-degree robbery and theft of a motor vehicle. Both are felonies. A lesser charge of attempted second-degree robbery was dismissed.\n\nThe jury deliberated for about five hours before reaching the verdict.\n\nProsecutors said that last June, Hunter and three accomplices forced their way into a house in the 13000 block of Southeast 212th Street, held the three adults inside at gunpoint and ransacked the house.\n\nOne of the men, prosecutors said, then led the woman who owned the house to her garage where he told her to take her keys and go with him in her Mercedes Benz SUV.\n\nThe woman, a 44-year-old mother of four, complied and was later released. She testified at Hunter’s trial.\n\nProsecutors said Hunter’s accomplice abandoned the Mercedes in another neighborhood. A witness came forward and told police what he saw. Police tracked down the car and found Hunter inside it with a pistol.\n\nThe defendant told police she knew the Mercedes had been stolen but said she didn’t know it was a stolen car. She said she went into the house because her partner had been shot and she was looking for a place to hide him. She claimed the gun she had was hers and that she had it for protection.\n\nHunter"
