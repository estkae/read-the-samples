According to sources who spoke to The Hollywood Reporter, the tech giant is in negotiations with several top directors, including Angelina Jolie, Ava DuVernay and David Ayer.\n\nApple is said to be seeking A-list directors for the project, which could cost between $5 million to $10 million per half-hour episode.\n\nApple could be looking to spend as much as $1 billion to procure the rights to the streaming series.\n\nApple is in talks with a number of Hollywood directors, including Angelina Jolie and Ava DuVernay, about the company's planned streaming service, which has been given the code name "Project Yeti".\n\nApple is planning on building a worldwide streaming service, with the goal of landing scripted content in a bid to challenge Netflix. But Netflix has more than 100 million members.\n\nWhile it's certainly interesting to hear that Jolie is being courted for a role, THR didn't have any details on what character she might play.\n\nApple has long wanted to launch its own streaming service, but has faced a number of obstacles.\n\nIt's unclear whether Apple is interested in a fully scripted series, or if the service will also include podcasts.\n\nAnother potential impediment to Apple's streaming service is the cost.\n\nThe executive also is trying to secure a deal with "This American Life" host and executive producer Ira Glass. That could create the largest video-subscription service in the world. The Apple streaming service could even be launched for free with Apple TV. "The goal is not to become HBO faster than HBO can become Apple".\n\nThe company now has about 20 television projects in the works, but it still hasn't officially announced a video streaming service.
