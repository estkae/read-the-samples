Karkheh\n\nThe Karkheh (also Karkeh) is a river in Iran that runs through the Iranian province of Khuzestan.\n\nThe Karkheh runs in a northwesterly direction for the most part of its course, passing by the city of Dezful and meeting the Dez River at the city of Shushtar. The Karkeh River is the site of the Karkeh National Park.\n\nThe word "Karkheh" means "crumbling" in Persian, and is often translated as the "Loose River" or "the Crumbling River."\n\nThe river is the site of the first large scale water diversion and irrigation system in the world, constructed by the ancient Persians around 500 B.C.. The system used a complex network of canals in order to divert the water from the Karkheh River into a man made river, known as the Shaft-Well. The river was used to flood a series of fields, and was used to channel water into the Shaft-Well for a second flooding. This system allowed for a large area of fertile land to be watered by the otherwise small river.\n\nHistorically, the river is also known as the Choaspes, Chrysorrhoas, and Jaxartes.\n\n
