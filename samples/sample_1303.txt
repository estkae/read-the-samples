White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Monday accused CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta of "placing his hands" on a young female intern who tried to take the microphone out of his hands during a news conference with President Trump.\n\n"During President Trump's Q and A at the news conference, Mr. Acosta placed his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern," Sanders wrote in a statement. "This conduct is absolutely unacceptable. It is also completely disrespectful to the reporter's colleagues not to allow them an opportunity to ask a question."\n\n[Excerpt: CNN correspondent Jim Acosta says White House intern tried to take away his microphone at news conference]\n\nAcosta later said Sanders's statement was false.\n\n"I'm fine," Acosta told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. "The president's spokesperson is not telling the truth, though. I did not put my hands on her. In fact, I took my hands off her before she was pulled away. ... You know, Wolf, I think this is just a reflection of the kind of disarray and the kind of mess this White House is in.\n\n"They can't even keep their story straight," Acosta continued. "I think, you know, Sarah Huckabee Sanders owes me an apology. I think that it's a shame that the White House is saying this. It's a lie. And to call me a 'liar' and a 'dishonest person' in front of the world is outrageous."\n\nCNN Correspondent @Acosta: "They can’t even keep their story straight.

We don't need to do this."\n\nThe White House accused Acosta of "placing his hands on a young woman." (AP)\n\nCNN's White House correspondent Jim Acosta briefly refused to surrender the microphone when Trump called on him, prompting the president to tell him to get out of the room. Acosta later said he thought the president had made up a question about the Russian investigation to stifle him.\n\nThe woman, later identified as a White House intern, can be seen approaching Acosta and holding out her hand to take his microphone.\n\n"Pardon me, ma'am," Acosta said.\n\n"Let me go," she replied, continuing to hold out her hand for the microphone.\n\n"Pardon me, ma'am," he said.\n\n"I'm sorry, ma'am," he said as he moved away from her.\n\nShe persisted in reaching for the microphone, and Acosta said, "Pardon me, ma'am. You need to get out of my face. Please, ma'am. That's enough. That's enough."\n\nAfter Acosta's news conference, Sanders responded on Twitter.\n\n"I've just been denied entrance to the WH. Secret Service just informed me I cannot enter the WH grounds for my 8pm hit," Acosta tweeted. "Wrong. They just caved to [Trump] and Secret Service."\n\nAt the end of his newscast, Acosta was even more critical.\n\n"In the course of that, they blocked my ability to do my job, which is a constitutionally protected, in this country, and they made sure that you could not see and hear what was happening in the room," Acosta said. "I think that it's important to point out, Wolf, that I was accused by the White House of putting my hands on the young woman. That is a lie."\n\nHe went on to say that he and his team had already put together a report about the president's remarks at the news conference before Sanders's statement.\n\n"That would have been the focus of our reporting," he said. "But of course, you've seen how the White House has handled this today, which is they then sent out Sarah Huckabee Sanders to the podium, to issue a statement that was the exact opposite of what the president said here at this podium. And what the president said here is that he felt that I was somehow being unfair to him in my questioning. And he told me to get out of the room."\n\nAcosta also said he was "surprised" to be told that he would not be allowed to go into the White House because of the interaction.\n\n"The fact that they were trying to stop me from doing my job is what I think is wrong," he said.\n\nTrump's remarks came during a news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May after their talks at the White House.\n\n"That was a very strange moment, and I think it is crazy," Trump said. "I think it's a very, very serious moment. I don't think it's a question of me calling the press to be nice to them. I think that you have to treat the press with respect. The press goes with me around the country, they're in my office — you mean to tell me you don't talk to them?"\n\nIn an interview on Fox News, Sanders told host Bret Baier that Acosta's "pushing and prodding" made the White House's decision to suspend his press credentials a "pretty easy" choice.\n\n"The White House cannot run an orderly and fair press conference when a reporter acts that way, and refuses to yield to other reporters," she said. "It's within his right to take that action. It's actually not a question of can he do it. It's not an option for him. He must do it. And he did that, which is a shame."\n\n"That behavior is completely unacceptable," she added.\n\nAcosta said on CNN, "It was an absolute untruth, and it was said because they want to make sure that they have control over who gets to ask questions and who doesn't. It's not about anything that I did or didn't do. The White House Press Secretary is getting a little bit spooked about all the negative coverage they're getting, so they're going to come up with ways to try and shut people down. And that's just unacceptable. They can't do that."\n\nSanders's statement came after press secretary Stephanie Grisham's initial response to the incident on Twitter.\n\n"Today the White House fully supported a decision by the secret service to remove a reporter from the @POTUS event for trying to disrupt the event," Grisham tweeted.\n\nAcosta is one of the most visible faces in cable news, often playing foil to Trump at contentious press conferences and presidential rallies. Acosta often tries to ask the president questions in the moments before the microphone is handed to other reporters, and has made his points via outbursts and actions in the moment, including shouting and pointing.\n\nAt times, Trump has called on Acosta by name. But more often, Trump refers to Acosta as "CNN" — a way to lump the network and its journalists in with the other "fake news" media that he claims has spread lies about him and his presidency.\n\nLast year, Acosta clashed with Trump and White House staff during a briefing after the midterm elections.\n\n"That's enough, that's enough," Trump said, interrupting Acosta as he tried to ask a question. "That's enough. That's enough."\n\n"Mr. President, if there's a rising of racism, if there's a rising of anti-Semitism around the country, do you hold yourself accountable for that?" Acosta asked.\n\n"I am not happy with the tone," Trump said. "You shouldn't be either."\n\nLater in the news conference, Acosta was again refused a question when he tried to interject.\n\n"Excuse me, ma'am," Acosta said as a White House staffer tried to pull him away from the microphone. "If he doesn't get a question, then CNN doesn't get a question."\n\nTrump responded by waving off Acosta and turning to another reporter.\n\n"I'm not going to give you a question," Trump said. "You are fake news."\n\nThe CNN reporter, who has served as the network's chief White House correspondent since 2017, has drawn frequent criticism from Trump and his allies. Last week, his Twitter account was briefly suspended after he shared a video of Trump and a White House aide. The aide had attempted to take the microphone from him during the news conference, prompting a brief altercation.\n\nIn a tweet on Friday, Trump called Acosta a "liar" and said that "CNN should be ashamed of itself, having you working for them."\n\n"Crazy Jim Acosta of Fake News CNN," Trump said. "Remember when he totally fabricated what I said about the @AP and other news outlets. Such a dishonest person. Sadly, they will never report the truth"
