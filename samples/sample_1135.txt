\n\n\n\nWhen the pledge forms came home I was shocked at the number of girls who had signed up. Although our girls soccer team is very small, some girls on the team had never played soccer before and were very nervous about making a team. In my usual calm voice I told the girls that there were spots open and that they could make the team. We had a few more practices to go and the big day had finally arrived, a week and a half before the season would start.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe girls were so excited about the prospect of playing in a real soccer game that they did not realize what they were getting into. After our final practice we gathered all of our equipment, most of which the girls had not used yet. Then they realized that they were not just playing in the season opener but also playing in their first ever soccer game. I could tell they were worried about what their parents would say if they played poorly and the opposing team scored goals against us. I reassured the girls that the parents would not be angry and I had their backs. I encouraged them to enjoy the moment and to have fun. They walked out of the house and piled into the bus for the long ride to the field. It was their first taste of competitive sports.\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't know if the girls were nervous, excited, or what, but they were quiet on the bus ride to the field. When we got there, I introduced them to the coaches and the team. I asked the girls to look around at all of the girls that were going to be on the team. They cheered and all of the girls seemed to loosen up. When the girls saw the other team warming up they got nervous again. It was a good thing that the other team was the same age as us because if they had been older girls I think the girls would have been scared.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the parents came up to me and said "Good luck!" I said "Thank you!" Then I realized that this was our first official soccer game, not just practice. I asked her to be ready to take some pictures and she said "Oh, I will!" It was nice to have someone else taking pictures for a change.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had a smaller team so I gave the girls the option of playing in the back or up front. Some of the girls chose to play in the back and I moved the other girls to the front. The girls who were playing in the back ended up having some fun being able to defend and clear the ball. The girls who were playing in the front did well too. The score was close but they kept at it. They did not give up when they were losing. At the half time the score was 4-1 and they kept it close.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parents and I were both very proud of the girls. We gave them high fives and told them to keep it up. I knew that they were nervous but I could tell that they had fun and enjoyed playing. They won the game, 8-4. I am so proud of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nGo M M Soccer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM is for the goals that she scores\n\nM is for the goalie that saves\n\nM is for the team that wins\n\nAnd I love M so much\n\n\n\n\n\nThese last two weeks we have had our first soccer practices and game. We had a large number of girls sign up for the team and we were split up into two teams. We played in an outside field and the girls really enjoyed it. As we were warming up the coach asked if anyone had shin guards and almost everyone had borrowed them from a parent or sibling.
