Riot seems to be slowing down its champion creation process. Since the release of the current champion rotation, only five champions have been released. Each of these champions (except for Xerath) was tested in the PBE at some point, so we knew what to expect when the champion was released.\n\nXerath was the next to last champion to be released. He came out in the middle of the season and, because of his kit, has been popular for quite a while. He didn't really have that many people against him, and it didn't take him long to climb into the current meta. He was picked a total of 11 times in the North American Championship Series and showed a 65 percent win rate.\n\nZed, like Xerath, was released at the beginning of the season, but there are still people who have not really mastered him yet. His popularity in the NA LCS was fairly low and his win rate was only 58 percent. Zed's popularity has since risen to the top and he is now played regularly in the NA LCS.\n\nBrand is another interesting case. His play rate has risen from 0 percent in the NA LCS to 3 percent. His win rate is not that great (44 percent), but because he is a burst caster, he fits in with the current meta. As long as you have the ability to lock down one person for a period of time, Brand is pretty strong.\n\nFinally, Vi was the last champion to be released, but her popularity is still a bit low. She has been played nine times in the NA LCS, with a 43 percent win rate.\n\nWith those three champions, Riot has shown that it will not just dump out new champions on the game, and that champions will still have to be tested on the PBE before being released.
