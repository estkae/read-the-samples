Hey everyone, I'm working on setting up Windows 2012 R2 on a Hyper-V virtual machine in Azure, and I'm running into a bit of a weird issue.\n\nWhen I power on the VM, I see the VM reboot a few times, then I see a window that says it's setting up networking (though it takes forever, it just sits there doing nothing). Once this is done, I'm able to ping the IP of the VM from my own computer. From there, I'm able to remotely manage the server from the "virtual machine management" window in Hyper-V Manager, and I can open up a PowerShell console on the server (and do other things with it as well). I am not able to actually connect to the server via Remote Desktop Connection though (not even to the console that I opened with the PowerShell). I've tried running wsman quickconfig on the server (after trying net use, that just said that it was offline).\n\nThis is really confusing to me, and I'm wondering what to do from here. Has anyone run into something like this before? I'm not very knowledgeable about Azure in general, so I'm not really sure where to go from here.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nEdit: I just realized that there's a Windows Firewall on the VM, though I had unchecked the box "Block all incoming connections." Not sure if that could be a cause of this problem.
