3Com Corporation is announcing the release of the latest product in its wireless product family, the Wireless Media Bridge. This bridge enables the digital content that is created at a home or office to be distributed across a wireless home network, and in turn, wirelessly connected to the Internet or other networks. The company's latest product offers a wired Ethernet connection for distribution of digital content, and also provides users with the freedom of mobility and ease of use by connecting to the office network wirelessly.\n\nThe bridge, designed to offer the flexibility to support the two predominant Wi-Fi standards, enables the wireless connection of a home or office to the Internet or to networks inside the home, as well as to other devices in the home or office. 3Com's latest product provides an easy-to-use home network that allows users to share and distribute content, with full interoperability between wired and wireless network. This product delivers the flexibility and freedom of mobility to support the high-speed wireless connection that the home market has demanded, as well as the convenience of wireless networking. The new bridge is priced at US$149.95.\n\nThe 3Com Wireless Media Bridge supports 802.11a/b/g at 2.4GHz and offers a higher throughput performance over existing 802.11b wireless networks. The 3Com Wireless Media Bridge will support both the 802.11b/g standards, and is backward compatible with 802.11b networks. The 3Com Wireless Media Bridge has an integrated "bridge mode" that makes it an ideal solution for connecting a wired Ethernet network to a wireless network. The bridge mode allows users to leverage existing infrastructure to build a high-performance and highly reliable wireless network without the need for costly routers, bridges, and other hardware. This helps to simplify the networking of devices inside the home or office while offering interoperability between devices on the wired and wireless networks.\n\nSource: PR Newswire\n\nExplore further: Intel's new USB stick gets up to five hours' Wi-Fi use
