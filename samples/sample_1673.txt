"One of the fastest cars to ever leave the drawing board is a supercar from Volkswagen that never made it past the concept stage.\n\nThe Panoz Esperante GT1 concept car, which debuted at the 1999 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, was so outrageously powerful and fast that the U.S. government thought it was in violation of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s rules on roadworthiness.\n\nAlthough the NHTSA issued a waiver to Panoz that let the GT1 run on U.S. roads, the supercar was never produced in series form, and all 25 examples that were built have since been retired from road use and retired to collections.\n\nWhy the U.S. government thought a road-legal car that would have a top speed of 208 mph was a safety issue isn’t exactly clear. Although the engine that powered the Panoz was at the heart of a mid-engined sports car that was not street legal, the GT1 had a modified version of the Porsche 911’s 3.2-liter flat-six. The power output was cut from 480 hp to 360 hp for the road-legal GT1.\n\nThat was plenty enough, as the GT1 would have a top speed of 208 mph and a 0-60 time of just 3.3 seconds. But when Panoz released a car that went that fast, the NHTSA reportedly felt it needed to step in. So in 2000, Panoz announced that the car would no longer be street legal, and the entire 25-unit production run was moved to racing, including in the American Le Mans Series.\n\nIt was there that the Esperante GT1 really shined, winning the series’ GT1 class three times from 2000 to 2002. It also won Le Mans in 2001, but it wouldn’t be until 2003 that a GT1 would be driven on American roads again, this time as a Ferrari Enzo-based prototype. That car, the Vitaphone Racing DSR-I, also ran in the American Le Mans Series.\n\nWhen the Ferrari-Panoz racing partnership ended in 2004, the road-legal GT1s were retired, and the cars are now in private collections around the world.\n\nThe Panoz Esperante GT1 may never see the light of day on American roads again, but for car lovers in the U.S., it still holds the record as the fastest car to never have been officially certified by the NHTSA.\n\nSource: Automedia
