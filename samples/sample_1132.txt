"The International Monetary Fund has today warned the UK government that its economy could contract by 0.5 per cent if it leaves the European Union without a deal.\n\nThe IMF’s International Monetary and Financial Committee said in its latest World Economic Outlook: “If Brexit takes place without a deal on future trading arrangements, it could entail significant disruptions, in particular in the United Kingdom and in the European Union.\n\n“While the ultimate size of the negative effect on the economy will depend on the future trading arrangements between the United Kingdom and the European Union, the United Kingdom is among the hardest hit by Brexit, with growth projected to fall by as much as 0.5 per cent in 2019.\n\n“Overall, it is the United Kingdom that faces the largest negative effects, owing to its large open economy and the interconnections between the UK and European economies.\n\n“Beyond the large open economies, countries like Germany and the Netherlands have relatively strong economic ties with the United Kingdom.”\n\nThe IMF’s warning comes just days after the European Union said the British economy would shrink under every Brexit scenario modelled by its own forecasters.\n\nAnd today, the British Chambers of Commerce has warned that leaving the EU without a deal could wipe £100 billion from the British economy over the next decade.\n\nBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab dismissed the warning, saying: “In March the IMF forecast UK growth of 1.5% in 2019. Today’s WEO [World Economic Outlook] now expects growth of 1.3% – still one of the strongest performing advanced economies.”
