Sir Robert Hart, 1st Baronet\n\nSir Robert Hart, 1st Baronet (22 November 1823 – 1 September 1905) was a British diplomat who worked as chief inspector of Chinese Maritime Customs.\n\nHart was born in Fermoy, County Cork, Ireland. His father was a physician, and his mother was the daughter of another doctor. He was educated at Fermoy Grammar School.\n\nHart's father died when he was twelve, leaving the family in financial difficulties. Hart was forced to earn a living and so took a job as a clerk in the Civil Service of the East India Company at a salary of £100 per year. He became fluent in Urdu and Hindi. After six years, he left the service of the East India Company and moved to China.\n\nHe joined the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs in 1851. He worked at Amoy in Xiamen and at Shanghai. He worked at Fuzhou and Hong Kong. He spent some time in Macau before moving to Canton in 1859. In 1863, he was promoted to Inspector General. Hart was promoted again in 1871 to Chief Inspector, and became Inspector General in 1882. In that position, he was responsible for administering and enforcing the Chinese Maritime Customs' rules and regulations and for conducting negotiations with other governments. He negotiated many new treaties with foreign powers. He retired from that position in 1897. He died in London in 1905.\n\nThe famous novel "Lost Horizon" by James Hilton has a British consul who is modeled after Hart.\n\nHart was created a Baronet, of Claremont in the County of Cork, on 10 August 1899. He received several honours and decorations from foreign governments, including the Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath from the British government, the Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold and the Legion of Honour from the Belgian government, and the First Class Order of the Double Dragon from the Chinese government.\n\nOn his death, he was succeeded as baronet by his eldest son Sir Ronald Hugh Stewart Hart, 2nd Baronet.\n\n\n
