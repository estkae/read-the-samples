"“ This was a wonderful trip for my 6 year old grandson. There were many things to keep him interested as well as being educational. This was his first trip to a science museum. He asked a lot of questions and seemed to understand a lot of the things they talked about. We also enjoyed visiting the zoo which was part of the field trip. It was easy to purchase tickets and we received a discount. We loved it! ”
