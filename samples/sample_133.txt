Myanmar currency and coins\n\nMyanmar Banknotes\n\nMyanmar has a local currency, the Kyat, or K, named after King Thibaw, a former king of Burma. The kyat was introduced in 1923, replacing the Indian rupee which had been in use in Burma for about two centuries. One kyat is subdivided into 100 pyas, and one kyat is subdivided into 100 cents. Coins have been minted in denominations of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 kyats, and 1, 5, 10 and 25 pyas, though the highest four denominations are rarely used.\n\nThe coins and notes currently in circulation are:\n\nBanknotes Coins\n\nKyat\n\n50, 100, 500, 1000 Kyat\n\n5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500 Pyas\n\n1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 Cents\n\n50, 100, 500, 1000 Cents\n\n5, 10, 25, 50, 100\n\nCheck out the latest exchange rates!\n\nMyanmar Currency History\n\nDuring the last half of the 19th century, large quantities of Indian coins circulated in Burma. In 1885, Burma began to issue its own coinage, in a new decimal system. The rupee and the double rupee were equivalent to one kyat. These coins were not for circulation outside of Burma and were not legal tender in India. A similar coinage was issued in the last year of the 19th century, using slightly different weights and diameters for the three silver coins and for the copper coins.\n\nDuring World War I, the Burmese Government began issuing a series of paper notes for 1, 5, 10, 20, 100 and 1000 rupees. They were overprinted on banknotes of the Imperial Bank of India, the currency used for exchange in Burma until the mid-1930s.\n\nDuring the 1920s, the paper money of several countries was in circulation in Burma. Since the demand for small denomination notes was greatest, the British Government began to issue India notes in 1925. They were of low denomination, being in the denominations of 5, 10 and 20 rupees. The existing paper money was then demonetised.\n\nIn 1940, the Japanese occupied Burma and issued their own notes in place of the British issues. These notes continued to be in use until 1945, when the British re-established control of the country. In 1942, emergency notes were introduced, in the denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 100 rupees. These notes were overprinted on paper notes issued by the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nIn 1946, a new series of notes was issued in Burma. This consisted of Indian notes issued by the Reserve Bank of India, overprinted B.E.P. and the State Bank of Burma. These were in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 100 and 1000 rupees.\n\nThe present series of notes began in 1951. These notes are in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 kyats.\n\nThe "Burmese" rupee, issued by the British between 1885 and 1896, was a fixed exchange rate at 1 shilling 4 pence (two and one-third rupees).\n\nThe U.S. dollar was established as the national currency of Burma in 1885 and is still the predominant currency in use in Myanmar.\n\nBanking in Myanmar\n\nMyanmar has an international banking system, with at least 7 major banks operating there. These include the state-owned Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) and the private Myanmar Economic Bank (MEB), National Bank of Commerce (NBC), Myanma Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB), Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank (MICB), Myanmar Mayflower Bank (MMB), Myanma Ahlia Bank (MAB), and Myanma Security Bank (MSB).\n\nMost commercial banks use the SWIFT system to transfer funds, and many banks in Myanmar accept electronic banking services through mobile phone banking, Internet banking, and ATMs. Some smaller banks still deal only in cash, but since cash is used mainly for larger transactions and shopping, and with so many ATMs in service now, it is no longer a problem.\n\n\n\nMyanmar currency info\n\nMyanmar info\n\nGuide to Myanmar\n\nCurrency information on country homepages
