"LAS VEGAS — Conor McGregor’s coach says the mixed martial arts star is in “fantastic” shape and wants to fight Khabib Nurmagomedov on Oct. 6 for a UFC lightweight championship.\n\nJohn Kavanagh said on Twitter that McGregor is “doing very well after his surgery” to fix a ruptured ligament in his left knee.\n\nMcGregor, who is Irish, posted a message on Twitter on Tuesday saying he’s “ready” to fight in October.\n\nUFC president Dana White has said that McGregor, who hasn’t fought in the octagon since 2016, has two fights left on his contract with the UFC.\n\nMcGregor was stripped of his UFC lightweight championship when he opted not to defend his belt against Nurmagomedov, who was offered the opportunity as the next highest-ranked contender.\n\nNurmagomedov is the UFC’s lightweight champion and has been waiting to fight McGregor since last year, when he said the Irishman could make some money outside the octagon before returning.\n\nMcGregor was allowed to fight boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. in a 10th-round technical knockout in August 2017, as part of a deal that had him agree to give up his lightweight belt and allow Nurmagomedov and Tony Ferguson to fight for the belt.\n\nFerguson was sidelined after suffering a knee injury in a freak accident in August. He is now set to fight Anthony Pettis at UFC 229 on Oct. 6.\n\nKavanagh said on Twitter that Ferguson will be next in line to fight Nurmagomedov, but there is no certainty when the bout will happen.\n\nWhite has said that Ferguson-Pettis will be the UFC’s main event at UFC 229.\n\nNurmagomedov, meanwhile, has offered McGregor a fight at UFC 230 on Nov. 3, at New York’s Madison Square Garden. But White has said McGregor has other options that he prefers.\n\nNurmagomedov has demanded McGregor receive no special treatment in their fight.\n\n“If he wants to come back, if he wants to fight, we’re here,” Nurmagomedov told the website MMA Junkie. “But if he’s looking for a different fight, different opponents, different contracts, I don’t know.”
