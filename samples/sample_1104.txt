Today I decided to go back to the bickie chair and finish it. I already painted the wood frame and today I will go back and give it some personality. I used this tutorial from Blackbird Blogs . I liked the paint swatch approach, but since this is a sewing bickie chair, I wanted to put some pink in it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing I did was to find a few of the pink fabrics that I like to make some swatches.\n\nThe second thing I did was to decide where I wanted them to be placed and if I wanted them to be small or large, or big. I also wanted to decide if I wanted them to be placed in a diagonal direction.\n\nSo I thought this would be a good size and place.\n\nThe first thing I did was to paint some blue paint on the white frame. Then I cut some scrap fabrics and used the same blue to paint them. I think they are looking pretty good.\n\nI took out a piece of the fabric that I want to use on the seat cushion.\n\nI then laid out the pink pieces on top of the fabric. I used some extra fabrics to line up the pieces that I want to use for the seat cushion. I then glued them down.\n\nI painted over the pink fabric pieces.\n\nI then glued some leftover fabrics on the front of the seat to hide the part that goes down inside of the bickie.\n\nI will come back and cut the piece of the seat to fit when I put the actual seat cushion in.\n\nI then took a ruler and cut down the left side of the fabric and then glued it down.\n\nI am really liking how it is looking so far.\n\nI then painted the bottom of the fabric pieces. I then glued them to the bottom of the bickie chair.\n\nNow I have all of the fabrics on the seat cushion.\n\nNext, I took some extra pink fabric and covered the back of the bickie chair.\n\nI just used a glue stick to stick it down.\n\nNow it looks like it is really coming together.\n\nI also wanted to add some fabric to the back of the bickie chair to hide the rest of the screws. I used some scrap fabric that I had left over from my sewing project.\n\nI used a glue gun to glue the fabric on the back of the chair.\n\nI then added some fabric to the bottom of the bickie chair. I used the same scrap fabric that I had just used on the back of the bickie chair. I used a glue gun to glue it on the bottom of the bickie chair.\n\nNow it is all finished and it looks great! I really like how it turned out.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am really glad I decided to do this. It was not very difficult and it is a great way to add some color to my home.\n\nI will leave you with a couple of pictures.\n\nThanks for stopping by today!\n\n\n\n
