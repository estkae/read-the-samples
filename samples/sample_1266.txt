For all you backcountry chefs, GSIâ€™s cookset is the perfect choice for car camping. A whole 4.5 out of 5 stars from our reviewers. Great design and functions for keeping things organized and clean.\n\nI really liked how the plates and bowls fit nicely inside each other with a clear lid for the bowls. The size of the pans are generous for car camping, and I also liked the vent that allowed moisture to escape. My other complaints are that it is a bit heavier than other sets I own, and the plastic cup is a bit difficult to drink from.\n\nReviewers say this set is:\n\nGreat for car camping\n\nHolds together well and feels sturdy\n\nGreat for both backpacking and car camping\n\nOverall a great value for the price\n\nGet it on Amazon.
