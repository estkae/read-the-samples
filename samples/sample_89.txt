Today, in the form of yet another unfortunate casualty of homelessness, a man’s dead body was found on the street just outside of a McDonalds. Just a few hundred meters from the student dorms, where a guy was recently stabbed to death.\n\nI’m really getting sick and tired of living in this city, and I’m beginning to seriously think about moving somewhere else. A friend of mine has been living in Boston for the past 2 years, and he’s constantly telling me how amazing Boston is, and how beautiful it is there.\n\nI’m going to head to Boston for the summer, just so I can get a better idea of what it’s like living there. I’m really starting to lose interest in living here, and I want to try out living somewhere else before I settle on doing so. If Boston is not the place for me, I want to at least have an idea of where I should move.\n\nI do think, however, that Boston might be the place for me, and I’m going to be there for the summer, and maybe even beyond. That is what I’m hoping for at least, but we’ll see how it goes. I think I’m going to take a long trip back to India during this time, as well.\n\nI’m going to try to take a lot of pictures, and post them up here on the blog. I will be a bit busy with work and school and my internship, so I don’t know how much time I will have to do that, but I will do my best.
