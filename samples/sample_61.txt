"The Orangeville Banner\n\nOrangeville, Ontario, Canada\n\nApril 9, 1905\n\nPAPER HUNT CONTINUES\n\nINSTEAD OF CASHING $5.00 BILL\n\nA message has been received at the Herald office from Orangeville to the effect that a lady, who has had $5.00 stolen from her purse, did not give the money to an expressman, as stated in last issue, but to another man whom she has not been able to identify, and that the messenger from St. Catherine will not get the money unless he turns it over to her. We have been searching for this lady for several days, and when the Herald office was last searched, we overlooked this message.\n\nAnother story of the stolen money says the woman, whose name is not given, gave the money to a young man who said he was a messenger from St. Catherine, and promised to deliver the money to the party it was addressed to at Kincardine.\n\nTHE MAYOR DISQUALIFIED\n\nA meeting of the citizens of Orangeville was held last Saturday evening at the Orangeville Town Hall, with Dr. A. S. Gibson, M.P., in the chair, to take into consideration the statement made by W. A. MacLean that Mayor D. M. McKenzie was disqualified from holding office under the Municipal Act of Ontario. It was resolved that the matter be placed before the proper authorities for them to decide. The mayor then withdrew from the hall.\n\nMayor McKenzie’s statement in relation to his withdrawal from office is as follows:\n\n“In this connection I have no desire to act in any unbecoming manner, and I shall resign from the position of mayor. However, I do not desire to leave town. I will reside here and attend to my business as usual, and my many friends who know me and who are not residents of the municipality will be glad to meet me. I want to get at the bottom of this business and find out who it was that drew up the notice of my being disqualified. I was the first one to speak in this town against the big sewer, but I am satisfied now that my opinions are shared by the majority. I do not think that the matter will go much further than the city hall, and as soon as the legal steps are taken the city will be rid of this question.”\n\nSILVER ORGANIZATION\n\nWe are glad to learn that a Silver organization has been formed in this town, and that a meeting is to be held at the Orangeville Opera House next Saturday evening. This is an organization for the purpose of working for free silver, and they are working under the leadership of W. H. Phillips, M.P.\n\nThe representatives of the Anti-poverty society who are here this week will probably have an engagement to-morrow evening. They are endeavoring to make Orangeville the headquarters of the work in this vicinity, and several of the agents will be here for some time. The meeting will be held at the town hall.\n\nA prominent Orangeville man, who is in the wholesale hardware trade in this city, returned this week from Chicago.
