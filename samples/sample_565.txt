Every. Single. Time. When we get a winter like this one, I am reminded of the past. I am also reminded of how far I have come. I guess that’s a good thing.\n\nThis morning, I went to buy a donut from the bakery that is right next door to my job. I walked in and no one was there. I thought that was odd. It was 7:30am. When I opened the door to leave, there were three people behind the counter. They were counting money and filling up the pastry case. I said “hi” and the manager just said “hi” without making eye contact. No smile. No “thanks for coming in.” Nothing.\n\nJust a year ago, this would have affected me. I would have gone home and thought about it for hours. I would have been bummed. I would have been upset. I would have thought that the manager didn’t like me, or that the bakery didn’t like me, or something like that. I would have felt the weight of the world on my shoulders.\n"
