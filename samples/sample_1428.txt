Sassoon Inventions is a breakthrough novel about one of the most complex love stories of the twentieth century. Two gifted young men--the grandson of a wealthy industrialist and the son of a destitute Irishman--will be thrown together at a high-class military school in England. As their rivalry turns to friendship and their love of art grows, each will inspire the other to achieve a great ambition.\n\nDavid McAlary is the grandson of a wealthy industrialist. Though his family and his money separate him from most of his classmates at the British Royal Naval Academy in Dartmouth, his artistic temperament makes him sensitive to his peers' feelings and puts him at odds with his philistine grandfather.\n\nJoseph O'Connor is the son of an Irish laborer in London. Though his family and his limited education keep him down, his extraordinary talent and his wit win him friends at the academy.\n\nThe boys' friendship will endure long after they leave Dartmouth, through their school days at Oxford and their service together in the Royal Navy. But when each finds success as a painter in France, their destinies take them in different directions. Though their friendship is tested time and again, their desire to succeed as artists and their devotion to each other will be the greatest challenge of all.\n\nAlong the way, readers meet the two men's extraordinary wives--one a Russian princess, the other a French prostitute--as well as a host of eccentrics, models, and dealers, and learn how their relationships influenced their work. Ultimately, this intimate portrait of two men's love for each other, their art, and their times reminds us that for artists, devotion to one's art is the ultimate expression of love.\n\nÂ©2012 Ronald Sassoon (P)2012 Audible, Inc.
