The title page is not available for viewing at this time. This book is being posted as it was received in a used book sale.\n\nComments: This book is in very good condition for its age. No torn or missing pages. No water damage. The paper is browning but has not disintegrated. This book does have a few words in it that are written in German, but the main language of this book is English. It is also in the original German language as this was the edition that was used by the German military. It is very difficult to find a copy of this book in English that is this old, complete and in good condition. This book has the good drawings and illustrations that have been seen in other German U-boat books. This is the most complete, best illustrated and written of the German Navy Combat Underwater books"
