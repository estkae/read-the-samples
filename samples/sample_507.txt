I have been following a special course at Stony Brook University called “Lifelong Entrepreneurship”, in which I am studying what it means to run a successful business from an economic perspective. At the same time, I am also writing the script for the book of my life, and taking into account my own perception of what it takes to create a successful business.\n\nBoth have been going great, and this is because I have used all my life experience, as well as learning the skills of how to find a better job, how to start a business, how to build a website, and how to build a strong brand.\n\nThe lessons I have learned through the years, and in the course I am currently taking, is that creating a business is hard work. This applies to any industry, because it’s not just about the idea. It’s about executing the idea, bringing the right people on board, and having a company with the right culture, that truly wants to be a part of something.
