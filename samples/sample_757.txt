Saturday was our weekly date night, but rather than go out to dinner and a movie, we decided to stay home and have a relaxing night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAubrey went with us to the library on Monday and picked up her first book for the summer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe week started off on Monday with a fun lesson for our family, going to a concert, and meeting some new friends. On Thursday, Aubrey started ballet, and we're so proud of her. It was a tough transition for her, but I think it's going to be great for her. She is really excited to dance and work with the other girls.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis weekend we're headed to the Renaissance Festival for the first time, and it's so exciting!\n\n\n\n\n\nHope everyone else's week was great, too!
