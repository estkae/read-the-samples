"“Jurassic World” is going bigger, with bigger stars and a bigger budget.\n\nJ.A. Bayona (“A Monster Calls”) is in final negotiations to direct the sequel to “Jurassic World,” the hit dino tentpole that earned $1.67 billion worldwide last summer. Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly, who penned the script for “Jurassic World,” penned the script for the sequel.\n\nChris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are both expected to return, but not necessarily as the leads. Frank Marshall and Pat Crowley are producing the pic.\n\nWhile Bayona and Trevorrow are considered to be a package, the studio is trying to decide whether to retain Trevorrow as a producer or have Bayona work with an experienced producer. That will likely be decided in the next week, with a new writer possibly coming aboard, but for now Bayona is poised to make his English-language feature directing debut.\n\nPlot details are vague, but sources say the film will follow in the footsteps of 2015’s “Jurassic World” in focusing on the next generation of the dino franchise. The follow-up will be produced by Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley. The movie is set for release on June 22, 2018.\n\nBayona broke out in Hollywood with his 2007 thriller “The Orphanage,” and directed the ghost story “The Impossible,” which earned star Naomi Watts an Oscar nomination.\n\nBayona is repped by WME, Anonymous Content and attorney Marielle Tenghe.\n\nDeadline Hollywood first reported the news.
