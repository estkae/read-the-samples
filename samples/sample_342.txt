It's a beautifully written story and I recommend you all check it out. I loved it so much I was inspired to write my own story of 2 boys on a trip to Shanghai. Since I am in no way the author that Inu'sLurker is, I apologize for my lack of originality. But I thought that perhaps if I wrote about something that happened to me I would find it easier to write a story like this.\n\nAnd what happened to me was that one year, the day before my birthday, my mother and I went to China. Now that I look back on it, it was a very exciting trip, though at the time I was rather sad because I was turning twelve. I had been dreading the day, and it was nice to be with my mom because she always made me feel better.\n\nIt was also an interesting trip because we were staying with my Grandfather for a few weeks. He lived in Shanghai, and he was the one that took us to China in the first place. So it was an adventure for me to be in a place that he lived. I only saw my Grandfather on holidays, and it was a great experience.\n\nI hope you all enjoy this story as much as I enjoyed writing it.\n\n- - - - -\n\nIt was just before eleven in the morning when we arrived at my grandfather's house. We had been traveling for quite some time and I was very excited to see him. He came out of the house to greet us"
