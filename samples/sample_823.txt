US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday said the administration of US President Donald Trump will pursue “a very different strategic relationship” with Russia.\n\n“I’d like to talk about a very different topic, and that is Russia. We’ve all been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the election. We stand by those assessments,” Tillerson told a Washington news conference.\n\n“And we certainly acknowledge the right of each nation to pursue their own foreign policy, and I know that some of the charges that have been levied against the current administration have come from the real policies of the United States.”\n\n“I’d like to offer assurances of the American people. This administration has its own approach,” he said.\n\n“I don’t think it is useful to be doing a tit-for-tat with this,” Tillerson said.\n\n“There has to be a degree of respect in how we approach each of these relationships,” he added. “If there is not respect, that doesn’t create an environment for the way we do things.”\n\n“We are not asking for recognition of a new cold war, or a new anything. We’re just asking for respect of each others’ interests and that we work together,” Tillerson said.\n\nUS President Donald Trump had on Tuesday called for the restoration of a joint US-Russia ceasefire in Syria, a rare show of cooperation between the two world powers.\n\nTrump, during a meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan, also warned that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) must be destroyed.\n\n“Syria is waiting for the United States, and we hope they will not disappoint us,” he said, indicating he wants Russian President Vladimir Putin to engage the United States to destroy ISIS.\n\n“As far as Syria is concerned, the world is going to have to come together, and we have to stop the killing and the death,” he added. “We have to stop the gas.”\n\n“I think that Russia will make a big difference,” Trump added.\n\n“This is not a question of us backing out,” he added. “I want to get as many to (ISIS) as possible. I want to get the Middle East in general to get rid of it.”\n\n“But I think Russia will have a great influence over Syria. And to that end, if it is going to be an attack on the United States, it will be an attack on the United States. You can’t change that,” Trump warned.\n\nTrump, who has repeatedly expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, also indicated he wants the United States and Russia to work together on destroying ISIS.\n\n“It’s an honor to have King Abdullah of Jordan and his representatives with us. We’ve had tremendous relations with Jordan,” he said.\n\n“One of the things that we will discuss is the fact that we would love to have the Russians in a partnership in working out Syria, and if that happens, that will be a great thing,” Trump added.
