My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for 7 months. He's 23 and I'm 21. I never liked him at first because he had a bad attitude. But he's changed a lot since then and I really love him. I've been asking him when we will be official and he won't answer me. He said that he'll answer when he feels like it. I asked him if he has a girlfriend on Valentine's day, he said he was gonna go home to his parents. The next day, he asked me out. It's been a week and I don't know if he's telling the truth about being single. What should I do?
