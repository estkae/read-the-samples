Tobias Neumark\n\nTobias Neumark’s abstract paintings explore the relationship between the inner and outer worlds of the psyche and between a virtual and a physical space. He works with a process of painting that he describes as a sort of movement through space, which plays a crucial role in defining his works’ structure.\n\n\n\nNeumark’s works on canvas depict dark surfaces with subtle optical shifts. The fields and landscapes in his paintings exist in an altered reality, a fictional space that is both real and unreal. These two worlds merge in his paintings, creating a mirror image of space and time.\n\n\n\nNeumark’s painting process is also very much defined by the physical structure of his canvases, which often begin with a white ground on which the composition of the painting will be built. Neumark works with ‘forms’ – using the geometry of colours to create a composition with rhythm, based on an expressive dynamic, through abstract forms that are both figurative and abstract.\n\n\n\nHis use of colour is not accidental; for Neumark, the colour has a ‘psycho-physiological’ effect on the viewer. These works aim to suggest movement, as the subject appears in a number of different forms and states of being, depicting both inner and outer spaces.
