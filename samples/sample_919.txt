Wagner Brewing Company\n\n1315 W. 8th St., Cincinnati, OH 45203\n\nFor over 130 years, Cincinnati's been known for its beer, and one of the city's oldest breweries is getting a new life, and a new name. Wagner Brewing Company will be a craft brewery at 1315 W. 8th St. in Over-the-Rhine, making an old school lager called 12 Degrees.\n\n"The recipe for 12 Degrees was brewed back in 1887, and this is a beer that was brewed in the city of Cincinnati for 50 years, and then, because of prohibition, they took it out of production," co-owner Sam Landeck said.\n\nBut, this new beer isn't just about history.\n\n"12 Degrees is a lager, which makes it really smooth," co-owner Sam Landeck said. "It's a beer that everyone can drink."\n\nLandeck is one of the three partners who came up with the idea of opening a brewery in Cincinnati. He said their goal is to brew quality, flavorful beer.\n\n"There are so many great things happening in the city of Cincinnati right now, and we wanted to be a part of that," Landeck said. "We wanted to be a part of the revitalization of Over-the-Rhine, but also being in Cincinnati, Ohio, we wanted to make great beer, and it's the birthplace of beer. Cincinnati is known for beer. There's a great beer history here, and we wanted to be part of that and be known for making good beer."\n\nLandeck said he and his partners chose Over-the-Rhine as the location for their brewery because of the city's craft beer boom.\n\n"There's been such a renaissance in OTR, and it's becoming a destination for a lot of people, and we're a small part of that," Landeck said. "But we're a small part of that renaissance."\n\nCincinnati beer advocate Brian Pryor agrees.\n\n"We are absolutely in the midst of a craft beer boom, so the more the merrier," he said.\n\nPryor is a member of the Cincinnati Beer Committee, a group dedicated to promoting the craft beer industry in the area.\n\n"We're absolutely a craft beer destination," he said. "There's a lot going on in the area, and a lot of people are starting to realize that."\n\nThere are about 15 breweries in Cincinnati, and 12 more that are on the way.\n\nLandeck said the craft beer industry in Cincinnati is an exciting place to be right now.\n\n"The community here is really supportive, and people are really excited about craft beer, and that's something we really enjoy," he said.\n\n12 Degrees won't be open until June or July, but when it does open, it will offer a lot of different options.\n\n"We'll have a lager that's traditional to the Cincinnati area, but we'll also have a blonde ale, and a red ale, and a raspberry beer," Landeck said.\n\nSo, how do the owners know 12 Degrees will be a success? Well, because they've been drinking it.\n\n"We've been making it in the kitchen," Landeck said. "Our friends have been trying it, and they seem to really enjoy it, so we're going to go with it."\n\nFor now, the brewery is taking on small investors, but it will eventually expand to produce 10,000 barrels a year.\n\n"I think people are going to enjoy the beer that we make, and we're excited about it," Landeck said. "We can't wait to open it up, and we're excited to be in Cincinnati.\
