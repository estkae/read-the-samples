I suppose that is their job.\n\nThe reality is that it’s hard to get out of debt. It takes discipline and focus and time. That’s where My Debt Free Life came in. It really is the first book of it’s kind.\n\nWith over 40 success stories, it’s easy to pick someone that’s on the same journey that you are. Each chapter walks you through the process.
