Hi! I am a mother of 3 and have 2 who are not quite ready for school and 1 that is in school. They are 6 and 7 and I am looking to make some extra money. I have experience with babysitting, cleaning, cooking and my job of 8 years is currently allowing me to work from home so I can keep up with the needs of my children. I am responsible and trustworthy. Please contact me!\n\nClick here to contact me\n\nLizz
