Boeing to Cease Orders for Canadian 737 Max 8\n\nThe sudden grounding of Boeing’s 737 Max aircraft is causing a major disruption to the global airline industry.\n\nThis morning, Canadian plane manufacturer Bombardier announced that it was ending its contract to sell 75 of its CSeries aircraft to the lessor, and parent company of Norwegian Air Shuttle.\n\nAnd now, it has been revealed that U.S. aerospace giant Boeing has cancelled its orders for the Canadian plane, putting a hold on any future deliveries.\n\nThe grounding of the Max model of the aircraft has thrown the airline industry into turmoil. While Boeing does not have a huge presence in Canada, it is estimated that the company has invested $6.4 billion into the country in the last two years alone.\n\nIn a statement, Boeing said it “cancelled a previously announced purchase order for 16 Next-Generation 737-800 passenger aircraft from a U.S. customer and added a new order for 16 Next-Generation 737-900ER passenger aircraft from the same customer.”\n\nIt added, “this change resulted in a reduction of eight 737-8 MAX deliveries from the previously announced 64 deliveries through 2023.”\n\nWith the order having been cancelled, it is unclear if it will be restored in the future. Boeing said the cancellation of the order was part of its routine actions “in response to market opportunities, customer preferences, and our results in a competitive environment.”\n\nBoeing says it remains committed to its relationship with Canada, but the news comes amid concern over the safety of the aircraft. The model was involved in two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, where 346 people died. The cause of the crashes remains unclear, but both involved issues with the new anti-stall system.\n\nAfter the Ethiopian crash, U.S. President Donald Trump said the plane was “certainly” unsafe to fly.\n\nFollowing the grounding of the aircraft, Boeing has grounded its 737 Max planes across the globe. In addition, countries and airlines have pulled their planes from the skies.\n\nCanadian airline WestJet has also removed its Max models from its fleet, as did Air Canada and Lufthansa.\n\n“The decision to temporarily remove our Max 8 fleet from service was made as a precaution and is consistent with actions by regulators around the world, including the FAA,” said WestJet in a statement.\n\n“While we have faith in the safety and airworthiness of our Max 8 aircraft, this temporary action is as a precaution while we await the findings from both the FAA and Boeing’s ongoing investigations into the cause of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash.”\n\nFeatured Image: Pixabay
