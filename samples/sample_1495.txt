"The specter of moral disapproval of a certain vice is less fraught with consequences than is the issue of personal discomfort with that same vice.\n\nStill, I am gratified that The Atlantic magazine has come out with a strong opinion piece in support of legalizing prostitution.\n\nTo be sure, in his article, Conor Friedersdorf, author of "The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law," looks at some of the arguments on both sides of the issue of making prostitution legal.\n\nAfter weighing the arguments, he concludes: "There are good reasons to treat prostitution as an issue of vice, in which we discourage the practice of selling sex, rather than as an issue of crime, in which we punish the purchasers and sellers of sex. But when we do, we ignore the primary problem with a system that bans commercial sex while tolerating the market for sexual acts."\n\nHe then explains what I believe is the case: "Once the government decides that commercial sex acts are inherently immoral, the law of demand and supply ensures that many more will participate in the market for sex: Clients will be willing to pay more for the services of illegal prostitutes than for legal ones, while sex workers themselves will be willing to take more risks to avoid detection."\n\nWe all know that this is true.\n\nFriedersdorf suggests a solution: "Some sex-worker activists believe that making prostitution legal would actually reduce human trafficking, as the number of voluntary sex workers would go up, leaving fewer willing to be exploited. That may or may not be true, but for me, the more important problem is that if prostitution remains illegal, the violent criminal gangs who traffic in women will always have the advantage in this market, because they can offer an illegal product more cheaply."\n\nHe is exactly right about this. In fact, in my experience, once a client gets to know a sex worker he finds a way to avoid the high costs of going to the "middle man" by coming directly to the source for a bargain.\n\nWhat about the issue of moral disapproval?\n\nFriedersdorf addresses this, too: "Prostitution will remain illegal, and so long as it does, many men will seek to buy sex, while women and girls will seek to sell it. There are other factors in play, of course, but on balance, a society that makes it easier for men to seek sexual satisfaction without having to marry or commit to a relationship will always have more sex workers than a society that requires all men to satisfy their sexual desires within marriage. Even for those who believe that marriage and fidelity are morally preferable to promiscuity and infidelity, the numbers speak for themselves. Even with all of the vice-and-crime approach's costs, American society will have more sex workers than if we legalized the market for sex."\n\nWhat Friedersdorf is saying is that we can pretend that we have eliminated the demand for commercial sex, but that we have done nothing but push the demand underground. It also has the unintended effect of sending the client to dangerous, seedy places to engage in unsafe sex.\n\n"A moral vision that allows men to satisfy their sexual needs with women who wish to be paid for their sexual services need not undermine our social norms. It need not violate our social taboos. It need not disrupt our marriages and families. It need not even corrupt our children, if we educate them properly," he concludes.\n\nIn short, we can solve a lot of problems if we stop moralizing about prostitution and simply make it legal.
