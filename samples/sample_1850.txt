OTTAWA — The federal government is proposing tough new rules to crack down on tax dodgers — starting with a $25,000 fine for corporations that fail to report international transactions to the Canada Revenue Agency.\n\nSome experts say the change is long overdue.\n\nThey argue that, unlike the United States and Britain, Canada has largely ignored the problem of tax evasion — estimated to cost the federal treasury an annual $5 billion to $7 billion in revenue.\n\nOthers say it’s not enough.\n\nThey contend the new reporting rules are a diversion because they only require Canadian firms to report overseas business income earned in 2013 and 2014.\n\nThe rules unveiled Wednesday by the Department of Finance are aimed at making it more difficult for companies to evade taxes by hiding income in foreign countries.\n\nThey also limit the ability of companies to use offshore bank accounts to pay for transactions outside of Canada.\n\nThe department says many of the new measures build on earlier attempts by Ottawa to fight tax avoidance.\n\nIt’s unclear whether these changes will bring in more revenue or stop companies from trying to evade taxes by hiding income in foreign countries.\n\n“The budget measures will allow the government to gain greater insight into corporate activities,” Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said in his budget speech.\n\n“They will make it more difficult for individuals and corporations to hide the proceeds of their activities in foreign countries.”\n\nIt’s already illegal for corporations to use offshore bank accounts to pay for goods and services outside of Canada.\n\nBut in some cases, this activity has been taking place because Canadian companies need to pay a foreign supplier in its own currency.\n\nTo get around this, some Canadian firms have set up offshore accounts to use when they need to make an international payment.\n\nOttawa is also looking at ending the ability of a foreign parent corporation to lower the taxes it pays on dividends it receives from a Canadian subsidiary by taking advantage of Canada’s tax treaty with the country in which it’s incorporated.\n\nThe government says it’s also changing the rules to prevent Canadian-controlled private corporations from using the stock option deduction to reduce their taxable income by more than the amount of the deduction.\n\nSome corporations have been using this deduction to make it appear as though they were not earning very much profit, so they could minimize their taxes.\n\nThe government says it will also work to ensure that it has the appropriate legal authority to implement the changes it wants to make to the Income Tax Act.\n\nBut some experts say the government’s new rules are only a small step toward solving Canada’s tax evasion problem.\n\nThey say the real problem is that the Canada Revenue Agency doesn’t have enough investigators to track down and convict international tax evaders.\n\n“The sad thing is the CRA does not have the resources to enforce the laws that exist now,” says Denis Meunier, a retired deputy commissioner of the agency.\n\n“The reality is you can change the legislation. But if you don’t enforce it, it’s useless.”\n\nFor instance, the CRA is only authorized to conduct a total of 1,100 audits of international companies per year.\n\n“To think you can audit hundreds and hundreds of companies in a few years is unrealistic,” Meunier said.\n\n“It would take decades to complete such a project.”\n\nAnother expert says Ottawa should also be looking at the tax treatment of stock options and other forms of stock-based compensation.\n\n“Stock-based compensation is one of the greatest contributors to the use of offshore entities,” says Jamie Golombek, managing director of tax and estate planning with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.\n\nThe government may also be underestimating the amount of money that companies are hiding in offshore accounts.\n\n“We’re looking at tens of billions, not $7 billion to $10 billion,” says Meunier.\n\nDespite the fact that Canada has been trailing the U.S. and Britain in cracking down on tax evaders, the federal government is under increasing pressure to deal with the issue.\n\nLast fall, the Conservatives’ own backbenchers took to Twitter to express their outrage over the offshore dealings of the Bronfman family, which owns the Claridge empire and has been associated with the party for decades.\n\nA recent report by the Commons finance committee also recommended Ottawa find new ways to collect money from international tax cheats.\n\n“The government is missing out on billions of dollars of revenue,” said New Democrat MP Peter Julian.\n\n“When you talk about tax cheats, they cheat us all.”\n\nThe NDP is also pressing the government to launch a major study of tax evasion.\n\nThat report would look at how much money the government is losing to people who aren’t paying taxes, and what can be done to reduce the problem.
