The Town of Isabella has recently purchased a 2005 Chevrolet Impala with a raised roof for the Isabella County Sheriff's Department and Sheriff Ted Schrader is pleased with the outcome.\n\n"We were looking to replace a 1991 squad and the new car has all of the safety features we need," Schrader said. "The rear seats were a nice addition and the car has better visibility."\n\nThe new squad car replaces the squad which was purchased in 1991 and had 183,826 miles.\n\n"When we were looking to replace the old squad, we made sure we had the most bang for our buck and we looked at other makes of squad cars," Schrader said. "We're very pleased with the Impala."\n\nTown Administrator Peggy Scholten agreed that the purchase was a good one.\n\n"The car is more fuel efficient than our old one and will help reduce our overall fuel costs," Scholten said.\n\nThe vehicle was purchased through a bid process, with the town using Michigan State University Police for an analysis of what was needed.\n\nSchrader added, "It was nice to have a lot of time to look over the bids and consider all the options. The car is going to work out well for us and I am very happy with it."
