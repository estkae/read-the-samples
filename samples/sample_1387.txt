It is a great opportunity for the children to get a workout, and to meet police officers and learn how to handle themselves in tricky situations.\n\n"We are also giving the children the chance to do some self defence as well as a little bit of boxing, so they can defend themselves."\n\nAs part of the schools anti-gang programme, which is being run by North Yorkshire Police, children have been learning about what they can do if they are approached by a gang.\n\n"We are also doing quite a bit of anti-gang work," Mr Farrington said. "The police came in last week and gave the children a talk about gangs and what they should do if they are approached.\n\n"They told them that gangs can only exist if there is a demand for their services, and that if you don't join then there will be no one for them to make money from."\n\nA spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said: "A lot of young people get into gangs because they want to be part of a group. But we need to try and educate the children to make sure they are making good decisions.\n\n"The gangs themselves want to keep their gangs as small as possible, so we are teaching the children about what they should do if they are approached by a gang."
