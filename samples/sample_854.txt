The Zune HD does not come with a headset and you will need a wired headset to use the headset jack on the device. Since the Zune HD has a mono speaker, the best thing to do is to use a headset.\n\nUsing a Headset\n\nA Zune is designed to be portable, so it does not come with a bulky headset with lots of wires. If you have the Microsoft Zune player, it will come with a wired headset, but if you are new to the Zune and have a Zune HD, you will need to buy a headset separately.\n\nIf you need a pair of headphones or a headset for the Zune HD, a pair of Skullcandy headphones are very good and cost less than $50.\n\nAny headset should work with the Zune HD. A good set of earphones should do the trick, but any headphones will be fine. Most of the headsets have both a 3.5mm jack and a Bluetooth headset. The main purpose of a headset for a Zune is to use it for voice chat while gaming, or for listening to music with the music player.
