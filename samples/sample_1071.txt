Quality Assurance in a Corporate Setting: Thoughts from a former employee\n\nby Nate Lickiss\n\nApril 16, 2015\n\n@S2S_Chicago\n\nWe have all been told at one point or another that a “happy customer is the best business.” In the corporate world, it is a little different, but the idea still applies. Corporate management likes to show their support for employees and the corporate culture with high-touch programs such as volunteering and family events. These are great things, but have the potential to be overlooked because of the distractions that can be caused by the lack of QA/QC.\n\nSome people have had a very positive experience in corporate employment. They will tell you about the great training and career advancement opportunities that they received. They may even tell you about the great coworkers they had or the nice people that they met. These people are great ambassadors for the company and the corporate environment as a whole.\n\nThese same people will also tell you about a “one bad apple” scenario that they have encountered. This situation may have started with the “one bad apple” performing actions outside of their job scope that could harm others or be harmful to the company’s reputation. It could also be a situation where a manager treated a good employee poorly, causing them to go back and rethink their career goals.\n\nAs an employer, it is a great idea to seek out the “good” employees to promote to higher positions. They can provide the best training opportunities, share their positive experience, and encourage the growth of the company. However, it is just as important to seek out the “bad” employees. These people can shed light on what not to do, provide tips on what works well, and help point out problems that might be encountered later on.\n\nA lot of this can be done during exit interviews. These are opportunities to find out why the employee is leaving. I have always heard that companies like to have two exit interviews: one to find out why they are leaving and one to find out what it will take to get them to stay. I have never worked for a company that did this, but it would be great to see how well it worked.\n\nAnother great way to get honest feedback is to survey the employees anonymously. It is a great idea to let the employee know that their feedback is anonymous, but it is important to let them know that there is a potential that the feedback will be used in management decisions. I always thought it was weird when a manager would say “that feedback was very helpful.” I always wondered if that feedback was used and how much of it was used.\n\nIt is important to realize that quality assurance is important in all aspects of life, not just corporate work. I have had good and bad experiences in the corporate world. But, I have also had good and bad experiences in the corporate world. One of my favorite quotes is “don’t stop thinking about tomorrow,” so I would like to share some thoughts on my past corporate experience.\n\nThese are just my opinions and I am sure other people have had different experiences. Feel free to share your experiences below.\n\nThings to Think About Before You Become an Employee\n\n1. Don’t assume you have any special abilities just because you were promoted. If you are promoted to a new position, you need to realize that you are new to the responsibilities of that position.\n\n2. Take everything with a grain of salt. The people that you work with and the manager that you have are going to play a huge role in your work experience. If you have a bad manager, you need to do your best to work well with him/her and not hold a grudge.\n\n3. Learn to deal with different personalities. Sometimes, this can be a huge issue. If your personality and someone else’s personality clash, you are going to have a bad work experience.\n\n4. Be a good listener. If you hear something that is a problem, write it down and figure out a way to fix it.\n\n5. Don’t take everything personally. You are going to get bad feedback on occasion, so make sure that you don’t take it to heart.\n\n6. Take care of yourself and your body. You need to make sure that you take time to exercise and eat healthy food. People who take care of themselves perform better in their jobs and are happier with their lives.\n\n7. Understand that you have a life outside of work. You can’t be at work 24/7, so you need to make sure that you make time for yourself, your family, and your friends.\n\n8. It�"
