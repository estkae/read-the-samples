"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian court sentenced 14 people to death on Wednesday for their role in a massacre during religious riots in the western state of Gujarat in 2002, lawyers for the victims said.\n\nRelatives of the victims of the 2002 post-Godhra riots which killed nearly 1,000 people, react as they gather around the van carrying the verdict on the case outside the court in Ahmadabad, February 22, 2012. REUTERS/Amit Dave\n\nThe attack on the Muslim neighbourhood of Naroda Patiya, in which 97 people were killed, was one of a series of riots in Gujarat which left around 1,000 people dead. The state was ruled by Narendra Modi, now prime minister, at the time.\n\nIndia's Supreme Court has said there is no doubt that Modi allowed the riots to happen. In 2012 he told an election rally that he had visited victims in hospital and hugged those crying for help.\n\nModi, a Hindu nationalist, has said he had been unfairly portrayed as anti-Muslim and blamed the riots on "a chain of minor incidents."\n\n"Under the current circumstances, and to my mind, at least, the chain of events do not seem to suggest a spontaneous reaction," the court said in 2012.\n\nA total of 77 people were convicted by the court, while 16 people were acquitted.\n\nMost of those sentenced to death were local politicians and police officers, said Raju Ramachandran, one of the lawyers representing the victims.\n\n"The judgement is historic," he said.\n\nA lawyer for the accused said he would appeal against the verdict.\n\n"We will appeal in the high court," said V.K. Amin, who represented former state minister Maya Kodnani. "There were no eyewitnesses and this verdict was given on the basis of circumstantial evidence."\n\nA spokesman for Modi declined to comment on the case.\n\nAfter the riots, Modi said India had been polarized between "Hindu and anti-Hindu forces," a reference to Hindu nationalists who accuse the secularist opposition Congress party of using the religious divide to win votes.\n\nMany of the riots took place in Gujarat state, where Modi was in power, although other states in the country's northwest, west and east also saw violence.
