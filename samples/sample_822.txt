The scheme is currently being piloted by West Sussex County Council but aims to be available for everyone in the UK who wants it. The council is aiming to have a potential service area that covers around a quarter of the UK population – approximately eight million people.\n\nUsers will be able to access the service through an app, for free or for a fee – although the council has not yet decided on the pricing model – that will help them identify and arrange home and visiting care.\n\nThe council has already run two tests of the app to look at the system’s usability, and although not all the features of the service have been released, it has been made available to “hundreds of people”.\n\nIn the first test, the council asked users to identify what they would find most useful from the app.\n\nThey were also asked to discuss their needs, which in turn helped the council to identify the features that were likely to be most important for users.\n\nThe second test saw the council work with users with more significant health conditions – although they were not part of a specific group – and this helped it to further refine the service and identify other potential features, the council said.\n\nIt is now focusing on two potential versions of the app, which is expected to be ready by September 2018.\n\nThe scheme is one of a number of digital offerings that are part of the council’s drive to transform the way it provides public services.\n\nAmong these is a new online service that lets residents book a new council tax or non-tax payers tax in a matter of minutes, as well as new apps that can help them report problems with streets, bins and trees.
