Pope Francis told journalists Thursday that it is not enough to be a good Catholic; one also must evangelize others in the faith.\n\n“Being a good Catholic, being a good Christian, is not enough,” the pope said, speaking to journalists in the papal plane.\n\nFrancis noted that in his youth there were few Catholics in Argentina, so when people became baptized, it made a “big noise.”\n\n“Now we have many more Catholics, and many Catholics who even call themselves good Catholics, but they do not go to Mass, they do not go to confession, they do not know their catechism.”\n\n“They’re not Catholics,” he said.\n\n“If a person is not open to new life, is not open to the other, is not evangelizing, that person is not a good Christian.”\n\nAs he has in the past, Francis spoke out against an “invasive culture of comfort,” in which people are “satisfied” and stop seeking God.\n\n“Being a Christian is not the result of an interior choice or a vague inclination. It is not enough to be just a ‘nice guy,’” he said.\n\nThe pope noted that in the time of St. Paul, there was a prevalent belief that in order to gain access to the temple, it was enough to pay taxes and be a Roman citizen, and Paul had to tell them that they were “without God.”\n\n“In our time, we are a little like the pagans of Paul’s time,” he said.\n\n“We go along thinking, we are a ‘citizen,’ a ‘good person,’ a ‘good Catholic,’ a ‘good Christian,’ and we do not realize that we are ‘without God.’”\n\nTo be a Christian, he said, is to “make Jesus Christ be born in every person.”\n\n“I do not want to be a ‘citizen,’ I do not want to be ‘a nice guy.’ No, I want to be a Christian,” the pope said.\n\nFollow Thomas D.
