"Two men who allegedly took part in a ring of thieves that stole up to $300,000 from Whole Foods stores in the Northeast have been indicted, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said Thursday.\n\nJames Baggett, 49, of Manhattan, and Bryan C. Reed, 37, of Pennsylvania, allegedly stole from eight stores in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania by exploiting a software glitch, authorities said.\n\nIn a scheme that began in March 2013, a man would buy gift cards from the health food chain and, along with other accomplices, call to have them loaded with more money than they were worth.\n\nA New Jersey Whole Foods store is the target of a credit card skimming ring.
