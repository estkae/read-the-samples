"Globe Telecom and Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) have agreed to a share swap which would transfer majority control of Digitel Mobile Philippines (DMPC) to the incumbent telco.\n\nGlobe and PLDT said in a joint statement on Monday that they had signed a share exchange agreement to transfer all outstanding shares of PLDT to Globe in exchange for a combination of Globe shares and cash, totaling up to P67.8 billion (US$1.2 billion) at the current exchange rate.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Globe would take majority control of DMPC, which owns and operates the Talk ‘N Text brand of mobile services. The Philippines’ Supreme Court recently allowed PLDT to exercise its right to full control over DMPC. PLDT owned 53.49 percent of DMPC and Globe owned 46.51 percent.\n\nA Globe executive said the PLDT deal would allow Globe to gain a large increase in customers, but would not directly result in a large increase in capital expenditure.\n\nThe transfer of PLDT shares to Globe would trigger a mandatory tender offer to acquire the shares that it did not already own in DMPC. Globe would offer to pay P9.95 per share in cash or about P2.1 billion (US$41.7 million) for the shares that it did not already own in DMPC.\n\nOnce the mandatory tender offer had been accepted by PLDT, Globe would own 94.24 percent of DMPC.\n\nThe transfer of PLDT shares to Globe would be followed by the compulsory redemption by PLDT of shares in DMPC which it did not already own.\n\n“In the aggregate, the PLDT shares that are being acquired by Globe and the compulsory redemption of PLDT shares in DMPC would result in the redemption of 76.95 percent of the outstanding shares of DMPC,” Globe said.\n\nThe two telcos said the transaction would allow them to resolve “certain legal and regulatory issues with respect to the relationship between PLDT and DMPC and between PLDT and Globe.”\n\nThese issues included the rights of Globe to access to, and the use of, PLDT’s network facilities and infrastructure.\n\nThe deal was expected to be completed within the first quarter of next year.
