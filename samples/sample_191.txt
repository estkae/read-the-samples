Reduce your page’s load time\n\nGoogle uses the page load time as one of the factors when determining your search engine rankings. You can use PageSpeed Insights to measure the page load time for any URL.\n\nYou should aim for a score of 90/100 and lower. It’s worth pointing out that although this factor is being used as a ranking factor, a slow site will have a negative impact on user experience, which in turn will affect your brand image, search results, and conversions.\n\n2. Enable GZIP compression\n\nGZIP compression compresses the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your web pages, which reduces the size of those files and the total data transferred to the user. Google uses this factor to determine page load time.\n\nPageSpeed Insights has a compression test that allows you to measure the level of compression achieved by your website.\n\nFor more information on how to enable GZIP compression, see this article.\n\n3. Enable HTTPS\n\nHTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) allows websites to tell browsers to avoid interacting with any sites except the ones that use HTTPS. This is useful in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nAs of this writing, Google considers HTTPS as a ranking factor in its search algorithm.\n\nThe problem is that although enabling HTTPS is pretty easy (for WordPress websites), it’s not so easy when you have to replace all of your URLs with HTTPS URLs, and make sure that your backlinks are using HTTPS.\n\nIf you’re not ready to migrate, you can use the free tool from CloudFlare, which allows you to encrypt your WordPress website and even apply SSL to all of your images, making the switch to HTTPS easy and effective.\n\n4. Check your internal links\n\nInternal links are links that point to another page on your own website. Google uses these links to determine the value of the pages in your website, and how well your site is structured.\n\nLink-building specialists will tell you that there are a lot of ways to build good quality links.\n\nFor example, you can use social bookmarking sites, forums, and blogs. For links pointing to your website, you can ask friends, relatives, clients, and business partners to post links to your website on their websites.\n\nBut, you should do this within reason, and avoid looking like a link-building spammer.\n\n5. Include internal links in your blog posts\n\nYour blog posts should include internal links, to ensure that Google can detect the relationships between your posts. This will also improve your readers’ experience by allowing them to quickly find the posts that are most relevant to them.\n\n6. Create an XML sitemap\n\nAn XML sitemap is a page on your website that contains a list of all the URLs on your website. If you’ve been blogging for some time, you’ve probably already created a sitemap to allow search engines to crawl your site.\n\nThe problem is that search engines do not use the sitemap file on your website to crawl your website. In other words, sitemap file is useless to search engines.\n\nFortunately, there’s a free plugin from Yoast that can automatically generate an XML sitemap and also add the sitemap to your website.\n\n7. Install social sharing plugins\n\nSocial media is a great way to market your website and brand. Not only that, you can also use social media as a way to improve your search engine rankings.\n\nWhen you share your content on social media, you can make the content more accessible to your visitors. Not to mention the fact that social sharing plugins also provide users with a link to your content, which is great for SEO.\n\nSome of the best social sharing plugins for WordPress websites include Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter.\n\n8. Install and enable W3 Total Cache\n\nW3 Total Cache can greatly improve your website’s load speed by enabling caching for your website’s pages, posts, and images.\n\nYou can read my review of W3 Total Cache to learn more.\n\n9. Install and enable Yoast SEO\n\nYoast SEO allows you to configure your search engine settings for each post and page on your website. It’s the most powerful SEO plugin for WordPress.\n\nFor more information on how to configure Yoast SEO for optimal SEO, see my tutorial on SEO for WordPress.\n\n10. Install and configure Google XML Sitemaps\n\nThis is another free plugin from Google that generates an XML sitemap for your website. This sitemap will allow search engines to crawl your website faster and more efficiently.\n\nIt also helps you to build quality backlinks to your website. The links in the XML sitemap are much stronger than the links in your sitemap file, because they are permanent links.\n\nYou can read more about how to configure Google XML Sitemaps for optimal SEO.\n\n11. Install and enable Google Analytics\n\nGoogle Analytics is a free analytics tool from Google that lets you monitor your website’s performance, including the number of visitors you’re getting, where they’re coming from, and what they’re doing on your website.\n\nI have my own tutorial on how to configure Google Analytics for optimal SEO.\n\n12. Install and enable Google Webmaster Tools\n\nWebmaster Tools is another free tool from Google that lets you verify your website and configure a wide range of settings, including your preferred domain, how your website is indexed, what the canonical URLs are, whether you allow Google to crawl dynamic pages, whether you allow web crawlers to follow your links, and whether you allow Google to scan your pages for malware.\n\nWebmaster Tools is especially useful for websites that have a lot of dynamic pages, and pages that are indexed using non-standard URLs.\n\n13. Install and enable Google Analytics by Yoast\n\nGoogle Analytics by Yoast is another free plugin that allows you to synchronize your Google Analytics account with the most popular SEO plugin for WordPress, Yoast SEO.\n\nWith this plugin, you can easily add your Google Analytics tracking code to all your posts, pages, and sidebars, without having to manually add the tracking code for each post.\n\n14. Submit your website to Google\n\nIf you have a new website, you should submit it to Google Webmaster Tools, which will allow Google to index your website and create a site map.\n\n15.
