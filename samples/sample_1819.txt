The presidency and commander-in-chief has its many perks, not the least of which is the ability to fly aboard the Air Force One. It's even better when you get to do it with the person who occupies the Oval Office. That was the case for the combined graduation ceremony of the U.S. Air Force Academy and the Air Force Officer Training School at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama last Friday.\n\nDuring the graduation, President Obama's daughter, Malia, showed up to watch the festivities. It turns out that while she was there, she joined the Commander-in-Chief for a bit of a surprise.\n\nAccording to the Air Force, Obama, his wife and their two children boarded Air Force One for the flight back to Washington, D.C., but decided to return to Maxwell. That's when the president decided to bring Malia, along with her friends, aboard for a ride.\n\nWhile in flight, President Obama and his daughter decided to join Air Force One pilots and flight crew in the cockpit. There they took turns flying the plane.
