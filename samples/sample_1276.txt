"Finally, I was able to get in and get an oil change! I can only go to so many places before I feel like the people are just trying to make money off of me. I've been reading reviews on this site for a while and decided to come here today because I really needed my oil changed. There was a little wait, but I think it was worth it. They do offer free wifi and a little waiting room with a tv. I love the hours, being open on Sundays! It was a little cold and rainy today, so that wasn't fun, but everyone was really nice, no hassle at all. I'd come back for sure, but maybe during the week next time, or earlier in the day. more
