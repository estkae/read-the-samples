PRODUCT DESCRIPTION\n\nThis 10 slide video from Healthier Child incorporates the Water Bottle Challenge which makes teaching and assessing hydration easy and fun. Teachers can print out the template (see preview) and students can fill it out with each bottle they drink throughout the day. They can then graph their progress to see how they’re improving! This video also comes with an Assessment Sheet that assesses students’ Hydration Behavior. They can fill out this assessment by rating how well they were able to meet hydration needs for a period of one week.
