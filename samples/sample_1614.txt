KARACHI, Oct 17: Karachi-based doctors have sought judicial intervention to stop the ban imposed by the Sindh government on private medical colleges, terming it a violation of basic human rights.\n\nThe matter has now reached the Sindh High Court and will be heard by the full bench of the court on Thursday.\n\nA group of private medical college owners, principals and teachers have filed a petition with the SHC against the Sindh government’s decision to ban admission in medical colleges that are offering MBBS courses without the approval of the Medical Education Directorate (MED).\n\nThe MED had earlier announced that no medical college would be allowed to operate without its approval, terming the action a part of its on-going drive against medical colleges running in unauthorised and substandard buildings.\n\nEarlier, after the notification, the education department had cancelled the registration of 13 private medical colleges, and three of them were also de-recognised by the Medical and Dental Council of Pakistan (MCDP).\n\nAfter this, the Sindh government imposed a ban on admissions to medical colleges that have not acquired the requisite approval of the MED.\n\nThe petitioners have argued that the Sindh government’s notification was in violation of Article 18 of the Constitution, which gave all citizens the right to the pursuit of professional and vocational training.\n\nMoreover, the private medical colleges were complying with all legal requirements regarding their admission procedure, said the petitioners.\n\nThey also argued that the ban on private medical colleges violated the Supreme Court’s orders in the case of Sindh Medical University and Indus Hospital College, which allowed the private medical colleges to operate as long as they were in line with the laws.\n\nThe petitioners said the MED had also not yet issued its report about the poor quality of medical colleges.\n\nThe doctors who are running the medical colleges have complained that the present ban was causing immense hardships to them and their students.
