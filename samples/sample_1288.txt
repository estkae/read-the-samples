I have been in my 20's for a few months and I've been quite busy. I feel as though I have achieved a lot and that this year is going to be even better. I just found out I got a job I applied for so I am pretty excited about that. I also have a doctor's appointment later this week, I have to get a cholesterol check so I'm hoping that everything is alright with that. I got some free bookmarks from Google+ to give out to people.\n\nThe weather has been quite nice here. It's been cold, but there has been so much sunshine that it's a great day. I like the weather this time of year. I think we're finally starting to feel like summer is going to come again. I have been going to the gym more often, although not as often as I'd like. I have started lifting weights and I feel stronger already. I'm hoping to build my arms.\n\nI've been getting more into photography and I want to start learning more about film. It's a slow process, but I've been looking at cameras and accessories. I have my eye on a few but I don't want to spend a lot of money. I have my little plastic camera, a Diana Mini, that I am getting some nice pictures out of. I'm learning how to get the best out of the film and I have been looking at some Flickr groups that are sharing Diana pictures.\n\nI've been getting into Etsy lately. It's a lot of fun to find new things and I really like the way you can get a feel for what the person is like. I have been looking at things and I have found a few good shops. I want to find a few good artists that I like.\n\nI have been spending a lot of time on"
