BAGHDAD — Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Monday presented a proposed new Cabinet to parliament for approval, which is expected to include a defense minister and an interior minister.\n\nAbadi said in a statement that a number of the ministers would remain in their posts, while some would get new assignments and one would be replaced.\n\nThe move would boost his government’s credibility as it takes on the Islamic State group, which swept across much of northern and western Iraq last summer. It would also help the prime minister gain influence with a parliament elected in April.\n\nLawmakers met Monday afternoon in a closed session to hear from the prime minister and approve the new Cabinet.\n\nIraqi lawmakers already have approved acting ministers in the foreign and defense portfolios in anticipation of a new Cabinet.\n\nThe proposed new defense minister is Khaled al-Obeidi, the chief of staff of the armed forces.\n\nThe candidate for the interior portfolio is Mohammed al-Ghabban, an official in the predominantly Shiite paramilitary forces known as the Popular Mobilization Forces. The forces were created last summer after Iraq’s most powerful Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, issued a fatwa, or religious decree, calling for Iraqis to fight the extremists.\n\nThe new Cabinet members will have to undergo further screening before they can be sworn in.\n\nAn aide to the prime minister told The Associated Press that the interior minister would replace Mohammed Salem al-Ghabban, who has been acting minister since March. The aide spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nThe process of forming the Cabinet has been drawn out, with delays because of disputes between Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish blocs over who would hold key posts.\n\nIt was not clear if the interior minister would be a Sunni or a Shiite. It also wasn’t clear if the defense minister would be a Sunni or a Shiite.\n\nWhen the new Cabinet is sworn in, the president will be able to name a new Cabinet as demanded by the constitution, giving him greater leverage in the new legislature.\n\nAbadi, a Shiite, has struggled to overcome his dependence on political parties, some of which receive support from neighboring Iran.\n\nDuring the U.S. occupation, he served as minister of communications under the Shiite-led government of then-Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. He was tapped as prime minister last summer after his predecessor was ousted amid an Islamic State offensive that overran about a third of the country.\n\nAbadi promised to unite Iraq, which is divided among Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds, but has struggled to overcome his dependence on political parties, some of which receive support from neighboring Iran.\n\nThe State Department in Washington announced the appointment Monday of Stuart Jones, a career diplomat, as the new U.S. ambassador to Iraq, replacing Douglas Silliman.
