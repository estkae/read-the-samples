"Public Bookmark *\n\nJames “Bucky” Barnes was born in the dead of night, right at the edge of winter and the approaching storm. At least, that’s how his mother likes to tell it. Her mother, a woman who had been born with the gift of sight, had foretold that James would be born during a storm, that his destiny would be caught up in a whirlwind, that he would live a life surrounded by shadows. And in the shadow of the war, there were few people more surrounded by them.\n\nHe lived in the shadow of Steve Rogers and it was only in the wake of his death that James could finally step out from it, could step out of the shadows.\n\nIt is a slow process, this transition. He tries to move forward, but it is difficult.\n\nSome habits are harder to break than others.
