The former head of the Democratic National Committee has a new role: commentator for the pro-Russia network RT.\n\nDonna Brazile’s contract with CNN was suspended last year after it was revealed that she shared debate questions with the Clinton campaign during the primaries. Now, she will make regular appearances on the Russian-government-funded media outlet.\n\nShe will be a contributor for the channel’s “Political Gabfest” program, according to a press release sent out Tuesday by the network.\n\n“The most exciting part of joining the ‘Political Gabfest’ is that I will be back in action on the campaign trail! I am eager to talk about the 2020 election and the road ahead for all of us,” Brazile said in a statement.\n\nBrazile is no stranger to controversy: In 2017, she published a book, Hacks, which included passages that some say contradicted her earlier denials about sharing the debate questions.\n\nIn her new role, Brazile will appear alongside former NPR program hosts (and brothers) John and Jon Ganzfried. The two work on RT under the name “The Gentlemen,” hosting the program “The Big Picture.”\n\n“Our show is about ‘the big picture’ issues facing America and the world, and how the decisions made by our government leaders both affect our daily lives and shape our nation’s future,” the brothers said in a statement. “We look forward to our spirited conversations with Donna, as well as her take on the most pressing issues of the day.”\n\nAs head of the DNC, Brazile gave the Clinton campaign a heads up on questions to expect during the primary debate against Bernie Sanders. In the book, she said she “wondered” whether she should give the Clinton team a heads up about the questions for the general election debates, but did not ultimately do so.\n\nRT’s founders and owners have direct ties to the Kremlin, and its funding comes from the Russian government.\n\nIn an interview with Variety, the brothers defended their role on RT, saying that they “weren’t trying to accomplish anything” by appearing on the network.\n\n“The network is no different from other networks, it’s just like CNN, MSNBC, or Fox,” said John Ganzfried.\n\n“The only difference is that they were more truthful about what they are. We are trying to be honest about what we are and that’s it.”\n\nHe added: “We have a lot of freedoms over here to do what we want, and the contracts we have over here are very fair.”\n\nRT has been the subject of criticism over its coverage of U.S. politics.\n\nIn one of the most high-profile incidents, RT was forced to register as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The channel is now required to include disclaimers at the bottom of its broadcasts saying that it is funded by the Russian government.\n\nWATCH:\n\nFollow Chuck on Twitter\n\nFreedom of Speech Isn’t Free\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation is working hard to balance out the biased American media.
