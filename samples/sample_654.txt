For in the great City into which I had just come the men pay no attention to women, but, seeing that beauty is free to all who care to pay for it, direct all their efforts towards keeping themselves as handsome as possible.\n\nSuch was his philosophy, and such was his practice. It must be admitted that the latter was consistent with the former, and that, whilst his follies were of the most extravagant character, he gave proof of a high degree of ability, and of a very decided will.\n\nBut it is not my intention to defend him, nor to excuse him. His life and his actions would, in themselves, furnish forth a romance, of which the life of the Marquis de Sade would furnish the dreary groundwork, and of which his own romance, entitled Justine, would furnish the dreary development.\n\nNo, no; I have no intention of presenting him to you in the light of a reformer, or of a philanthropist, or of a philosopher; he was a sensualist, a dastardly rascal, a debauchee, a liar, a cheat, a scoundrel.\n\nFor these and for other reasons, and also, perhaps, for the more foolish one that the Marquis de Sade has never been condemned, I have no intention of describing his life to you; I propose, rather, to deal with the thoughts which occupied his mind, with the rules which he laid down for himself, and with the singular and extraordinary notions which led to his strange mode of life, and which, perhaps, also, partly influenced his criminal and immoral conduct.\n\nMy task is a difficult one; I must be more exact than the attorney who defends, or than the advocate who prosecutes; and, whilst anxious to do justice to my subject, I must not overlook any of the circumstances of his life.\n\nMy subject is an interesting one; but it is very grave.

But that would be to do an injustice to my subject, and to treat it lightly. This man has passed through the furnace of passions, and he has emerged from the fires more pure than refined gold.\n\nTo the world he has always seemed to be devoid of talent. He has been despised by the upper classes and avoided by the lower. He has been ridiculed on the stage, and he has excited hatred in the pit.\n\nHe has neither money, nor honor, nor rank, nor beauty, nor social position.\n\nHe has only one quality—­one merit, one happiness, which is in a sense more than a mere individual happiness. He possesses the true originality, the true spirit of independence, and, if he cannot do good, he does, at least, no harm.\n\nHis is a generous"
