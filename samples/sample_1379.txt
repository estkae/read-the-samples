Best Amazon Prime Movies [Exclusive] 5 Cash Back Credit Cards - Top Offers 4.6 out of 5 stars 1,302 Instant Pot 6 Qt 7-in-1 Multi Use; 5 in 1 out One thing to remember when it comes to Amazon, however, is that it's all about the right now. The Echo was a surprise hit for Amazon when it debuted in late 2014. It even earned Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos a whopping $1.28 billion in the last quarter of 2016. But it was also a surprise hit when Amazon Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Black went on sale for Prime Day 2018. Each of those products has become Amazon's most successful product during the subsequent holiday season. So be wary of the too-good-to-be-true pricing for the smart speaker in July. Another smart speaker Amazon is sure to discount heavily on Prime Day is the Amazon Echo (2nd Generation). The speaker has already been heavily discounted multiple times, but there's always room for more savings. That's especially true as Apple is about to release its HomePod smart speaker. Every year, Amazon releases several new products to its Amazon Echo lineup, including Echo Buttons, Echo Connect, Echo Spot, Echo Sub, and more. If you've been thinking about jumping into the smart home world, then Prime Day is a great time to do it. While the prices of these items are unlikely to get any cheaper, at least you'll be able to save on the accessories you need to use them with, such as the smart plug and smart bulb. iPhone X A while back, you used to be able to find a 5-pound bag of Nestle Quick-Cooking Chocolate Morsels on Amazon for $22, which would make about 8 batches of fudge. Now? It's $5.59 for a 10-ounce bag. You might be tempted to think, "Well, $5.59 still isn't that bad for fudge." But that would be before you consider the shipping: $6.30 for the fudge itself, plus $7.99 for shipping, plus whatever else you throw in your cart for good measure. (Hey, Prime membership means free shipping, right?) Within a few clicks, you can find yourself spending as much on shipping as you did on the fudge itself. And as for that Prime membership? It'll cost you $119, if you want to take full advantage of all the benefits, including streaming video, free two-day shipping, and Prime Music. In short, Amazon's insane shipping prices can add a huge chunk of change to the cost of your orders. Also note that Amazon prices can fluctuate a bit, so your mileage may vary. It's still worth it to keep an eye on Amazon, because you never know when it'll have a great one-day sale, like on Nestle chocolate. (You can also get free two-day shipping via Amazon Prime if you're a student, which means a lot of college students can order candy cheaply without worrying about that added shipping charge.)
