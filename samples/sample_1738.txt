CNN commentator and host of “Anderson Cooper 360,” Anderson Cooper on Thursday appeared baffled after he was labeled the “most anti-Trump” anchor in a study from the conservative Media Research Center.\n\nThe study, titled “Study: CNN’s anti-Trump bent is now a clear pattern,” found that Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon, who host primetime and late-night shows on CNN, gave the president far more negative coverage than their colleagues.\n\nCooper disputed the study’s findings and told Brian Stelter, who is the host of CNN’s “Reliable Sources,” that the organization doesn’t put “an honest face on the show.”\n\nThe study revealed that Cooper’s and Lemon’s coverage of President Trump was 89 percent negative. Cooper said that he believes the research firm is using “cherry-picked” clips.\n\n“I just don’t think it’s fair. And I think it’s ridiculous. It’s so obviously not true,” he said.\n\nStelter said that Cooper’s coverage had been far more negative in previous months but appeared to turn more positive in recent weeks.\n\n“I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the improvement in Trump’s numbers is seen in the shows where the tone has improved,” Stelter said.\n\n“When you cherry-pick stuff and you say, ‘here’s two seconds where he said something negative,’ and then you take a 30-second segment and say, ‘Look how negative he is.’ It’s just not true,” Cooper replied. “It’s ridiculous. It’s absurd.”\n\n“No, it’s not,” Stelter replied.\n\nStelter said that the organization showed more clips that were more negative toward Trump than positive.\n\n“I’m not going to continue to argue with you,” Cooper said.\n\n“If you’re right, then, why did the tone improve on the air?” Stelter asked.\n\n“The tone improved on the air because it was more interesting to show the diversity of opinion that was out there,” Cooper said.\n\nThe media analyst said that Cooper was wrong and that the “tone has improved” on his show.\n\nCooper appeared baffled and disagreed with Stelter.\n\n“I think you’re cherry-picking clips,” he said.\n\nYou can Follow Nick on Twitter and Facebook\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
