"\n\nChaosbane is an isometric action role-playing game developed and published by Ebb Software. Players take control of an agent of the Order of Magni to defeat hordes of orcs and monsters in order to save the world from the god of chaos. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on August 30, 2019.\n\nGameplay [ edit ]\n\nPlayers select a character from four different classes - the fighter, wizard, cleric, and rogue - and battle across a number of locations, defeating various enemies and bosses along the way. Upon defeating a certain number of enemies, players can use crystals to level up their character's attributes and skills, but if they die, they will lose a portion of their experience. Players can also switch characters at any time if they wish.[1]\n\nSynopsis [ edit ]\n\nThe game takes place in the realm of Magni. In the first chapter, which is set centuries prior to the events of the main story, three dragons - Wrath, the red one, Wrath-corrupted, the green one, and Wrath's Shadow, the blue one - team up with the Order of Magni to defeat the god of chaos. The story then jumps ahead to the present day, in which the hero is tasked with discovering what happened to the Order of Magni and saving the world from the god of chaos.[1]\n\nDevelopment [ edit ]\n\nChaosbane was developed by Ebb Software and published by Bigben Interactive, with support from Cyanide Studio, and the game's music was composed by Olivier Derivière, who also worked on titles such as Obduction, Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana, and the Styx: Shards of Darkness. It is the first video game to be released by Ebb Software. It is built on the Unreal Engine 4 and was built using the Unreal Editor. The game was first announced on March 19, 2018, and a closed beta was announced in August 2018, with the Xbox One version being tested by console players.[2][3][4][5][6][7] The game's title was originally going to be Chaosbane, but it was later changed to Chaosbane: Complete Edition. This is due to the studio "really believing in the project" and "that the player deserved the best possible game."[8]\n\nThe game's digital deluxe edition and special edition, which was limited to 1,500 copies and released only in Germany, came with a Collector's Edition box, a special guidebook called the Codex of the Order, an Orc hunter statue, and a 10.1-inch figurine of the Orc shaman Leshrac.[9][10][11]\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nChaosbane received "generally favorable reviews", according to review aggregator Metacritic.[12][13][14]\n\nThe game's cooperative play, character classes, and amount of content received praise from Hardcore Gamer, saying it's "worth the purchase, whether it’s solo or with a group of friends. Just try to resist the urge to rage-quit."[16]\n\nOn the other hand, PC Gamer criticized the game's lack of character development, saying "The dialogue is the first, and worst, indication that Chaosbane is primarily a game designed for the player’s fun. Like every game with a multiplayer focus, the writing is more there to set up the next quip than it is to create a cohesive or interesting narrative."[15]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\n\n\n
