"After 10 years of repeated declines in raw milk consumption, the category has enjoyed a welcome boost this year, according to IRI data. During the first quarter of 2014, sales were up 12.5%, versus the same period in 2013, the market research firm reported. In an interview with Food Navigator USA, IRI’s Christine Barton attributes the increase to a resurgence of interest in raw milk’s supposed health benefits. “The benefit for those who can consume raw milk is that it does not have the additives that processed milk does,” she says. “So it's more nutritious, it's more protein and is also a source of healthy bacteria.” The source of the raw milk's "health benefits," which Barton goes on to list, is still being debated. However, IRI’s data does suggest that, whatever the actual reasons behind the raw milk boom, health-conscious consumers are at least driving much of the growth. According to Barton, in addition to the category’s high-end products, such as raw milk cheese and yogurt, “there has been a growth in popularity of flavored and specialty milk—with all the different types of flavored milk like vanilla and strawberry.”
