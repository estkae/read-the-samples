The Anarchist in the Library\n\nThe Anarchist in the Library: How the Clash between Freedom and Control Is Hacking the Real World and Crashing the System is a 2010 non-fiction book by American writer Cory Doctorow. The book is an analysis of the digital age, from the perspective of Internet activist Aaron Swartz.\n\nThe book contains material that had been previously published by Doctorow in magazines and websites, which were later edited for the book. It has a strong theme of Internet activism and the free and open Internet. The book is a collection of essays that had been previously published in magazines and websites, written over the period of the 1990s to the 2010s. Doctorow refers to the various publications and online postings where these essays originally appeared by chapter number and title, so that "The Anarchist in the Library" is an extension of the blog-like quality of the original essays.\n\nIn his review for "The Guardian", Paul Connolly describes "The Anarchist in the Library" as "not just a defense of the net, but a vision for a better future. It's a smart book, carefully researched and written with panache and wit". Keith Byers, in his review for "The New York Times", finds the book "occasionally confused" and "clumsy" but praises its "contemporary relevance and humor" and says it "has the power to open minds".\n\n
