The Pennsylvania governor's race is getting a jolt from two longshot third-party candidates â€” Libertarian Ken Krawchuk and Green Party candidate Paul Glover.\n\nThe two men were on the ballot with Republican Tom Corbett and Democrat Dan Onorato until the parties removed them. Onorato sued to keep Krawchuk on the ballot, but the state Supreme Court on Monday said he could be dropped.\n\nKrawchuk says he's energized by the attention. He plans a statewide tour and calls Corbett "the worst candidate for governor" in the state's history.\n\nGlover is campaigning in Philadelphia and plans a statewide tour with the Green Party, but he's unlikely to win.\n\nCopyright Associated Press
