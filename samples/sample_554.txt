Visitor safety and security are our top priority and we want to make sure you are fully informed and prepared for your visit. The Queen Victoria Gardens is an oasis of calm in a very busy part of London. With St Paul's Cathedral, the Tate Modern, Southwark, Borough Market and the Shard all on our doorstep, we've had to tighten up on security measures in recent years to ensure you are fully aware of what you can expect.\n\nWith the Queen Victoria Gardens only a two minute walk from Borough tube station, a five minute walk from Southwark and a ten minute walk from London Bridge, the Gardens is a great place to stop and catch your breath if you've got lots of sightseeing to do. With a large pedestrianised area and many benches and picnic tables to choose from, it's also a great place to relax and soak up the atmosphere.\n\n"
