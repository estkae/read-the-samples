"Image caption The number of cats killed has increased\n\nA ban on letting your cat roam free is to be introduced across Scotland.\n\nLocal authorities have been instructed to write to cat owners whose pets are not microchipped, neutered and kept on a lead in a designated area.\n\nIt follows a campaign by animal charities and the Scottish government to tackle the problem of feral cats.\n\nThe number of cats being killed in Scotland has increased from 48,000 to 62,000 in the last three years.\n\nEnvironment Secretary Richard Lochhead said: "Tackling the issue of feral and stray cats is a complex problem and that is why I instructed the Scottish government's Chief Veterinary Officer to establish a Stray and Feral Cat Working Group.\n\n"That group has looked at the issue in depth and has made recommendations to me on how to tackle the problem.\n\n"The focus of these recommendations is on encouraging responsible pet ownership, working with animal welfare groups and local authorities to educate owners, micro-chip and neuter their cats and keep them inside at night."\n\nTwo of Scotland's cat charities, Cats Protection and the Scottish Cat Action Trust, have been working with the government.\n\nFeral cat facts Domestic cats introduced into Scotland by farmers over the centuries.\n\nCats and humans have shared a close relationship for thousands of years.\n\nDomestic cats brought food into the home and acted as rodent controllers.\n\nThe cat has a reputation for independence and self-reliance.\n\nCats have the same needs as humans and require regular food, water and shelter.\n\nThe majority of cat owners are responsible.\n\n"We have been campaigning for a stray cat management law since 2006," said Cat Protection's George Henry.\n\n"We are delighted that, thanks to the efforts of Scottish ministers, many Scottish local authorities have put cat licensing schemes in place and that these are now being extended to cover all of Scotland.\n\n"This means that by next spring, owners of non-neutered cats found wandering will be breaking the law, rather than just failing to meet good practice.\n\n"We believe that this is an essential step towards dealing with the cat population explosion in Scotland and helping to control the suffering of stray and feral cats.\n\n"As a leading cat welfare charity in Scotland, Cats Protection is committed to continuing to work with the Scottish government and other groups to help reduce the population of stray and feral cats and help to rehome more cats."\n\nThe Scottish government is giving Â£200,000 to the Edinburgh and Lothians region to fund neutering schemes over the next year.\n\nIt has also given money to Strathclyde and Tayside to fund neutering and management plans.
