We’re almost at the end of the year and that means it’s time to look back at the shows that aired in 2016. In today’s analysis, I’m going to look at the best first episodes of the season. Before we begin, I want to note that these rankings are based on the first episode only. It does not take into account the series as a whole. Let’s get started!\n\n10. Kiznaiver\n\nKiznaiver has a great premise: what happens when you are forced to share pain? The series opens with a car crash scene that looks like it’s going to be the whole episode, but quickly evolves into a brutal game of betrayal and pain. It’s emotionally exhausting and does a great job of laying the groundwork for what is to come.\n\n9. Joker Game\n\nThe most forgettable show on this list. The opening scene, involving a rescue operation in Germany, is visually stunning, but it’s not really what the rest of the series is about. Instead, the main characters are slowly introduced and while that’s exciting, it doesn’t really have much payoff. I would have liked more mission stuff, but I have a feeling the show is going to go the route of a slow burn. The opening, however, is brilliant.\n\n8. Boku dake ga Inai Machi\n\nRemember that movie Sliding Doors? It’s basically the same thing except it’s a dude and the scenes take place in a city. Anyway, it’s very well executed and interesting. The show also throws in some time travel stuff for good measure, but not in a way that feels obnoxious or overused.\n\n7. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu\n\nThe opening scene for this one is a conversation between two inmates at a prison in 1950s Japan. It’s incredibly effective and the best part is that it’s not even the focus of the episode. Instead, it’s used as a way to introduce the main character, Yotarou. The rest of the episode is about his time in prison and how it affected him. It’s a great story and leads perfectly into the rest of the show.\n\n6. Drifters\n\nThis is the perfect example of an anime with a good first episode. It doesn’t waste your time with long-winded introductions, instead giving you just enough backstory to understand the series. Plus, it’s just so stylish and well animated. I can’t wait to see where this show goes from here.\n\n5. Re:Zero\n\nI think what I love about this episode is that it tells the audience that they can enjoy this series even if they don’t remember the LN. It wastes no time in introducing the main character, Subaru, and his situation. He wakes up on the side of the road and gets involved in the first of many wacky shenanigans. It’s not until the end of the episode that you realize he’s somehow ended up in a video game world and that the story will likely go in a very different direction than you would have expected. The best thing about Re:Zero is that it takes the “save the cat” trope and turns it on its head, which is very refreshing.\n\n4. Bakuon!!\n\nThere’s nothing particularly special about the opening episode, other than it does a good job of introducing the characters and their bikes. The real meat of the show is in the second episode, which involves the first real story arc. It’s when the show really takes off and becomes funny and memorable.\n\n3. Orange\n\nWhat I love about this show is that it doesn’t waste any time getting to the heart of the story. It begins with the main character, Naho, hearing a letter from herself ten years in the future. She relays the message to the people around her and as the story progresses, it becomes clear what the message means. It’s also about her realizing that she has fallen in love with a boy and then learning to live with that. That is what the show is really about. It’s sweet and perfect and it only takes one episode.\n\n2. Flying Witch\n\nThis is a simple show about a witch who moves in with her cousin and starts to live a normal life. The best part is that there’s no drama involved, it’s just about a girl learning how to be normal. I think that’s why this series works. It’s just a slice of life show about a girl, so there’s no expectation that anything is going to happen. This is a show that you can watch while doing your homework or eating a bowl of ramen and that’s why it’s at number two on this list.\n\n1. Mayoiga\n\nWhat makes this the best first episode is that it absolutely destroyed my expectations. I was expecting a dull, low budget horror story and what I got was an incredible story with high stakes and brilliant cinematography. It also introduced a large number of characters, yet somehow made them all feel important and necessary. This is an amazing episode that set up a potentially great series and that’s why it’s the best of the season.\n\nAnd that’s it for this list! What shows did I miss?
