I am not sure where to post this so here is hoping it is okay for this section, but I am about to make a cake and I know nothing about it and I am so excited!\n\nSo I am making a cake for my friend's 21st birthday party, and I am making it in the shape of an ice cream cone with a chocolate cake and strawberry filling. I need some advice though because I have never done anything like this before!\n\nI would like to put white chocolate chips on the cone, and I was thinking of doing white chocolate mixed with green food colouring, to match the cake decor (i.e. white chocolate to make the 'chocolate', green food colouring to make it the 'mint' colour), but I am not sure if that will be okay! I also want to use little cherries to decorate the 'ice cream' and I am thinking of making them out of the same chocolate as the cake, but would that be too rich?\n\nThe cake is going to be stacked, so I don't want it to topple over, and I am also going to have it sitting on some wooden blocks so"
