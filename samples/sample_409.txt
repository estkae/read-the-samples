To help raise awareness of depression and suicide, a group of engineering students from the University of Waterloo have designed a robot that can create artwork with the help of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nMental illness is a huge problem that often gets ignored, or underplayed. Although the majority of the time you can tell if a person is suffering, there are some cases where it can be harder to identify, especially if you're just talking to them on the phone.\n\nThe team of eight, led by Chris Cui, spent four months designing their robot, which is called DepressionBot.\n\nDepressionBot is now available to help raise awareness of depression and suicide 1:03\n\n"The robot is meant to help raise awareness for depression and suicide," said Cui, a third-year industrial design student, in an interview with CBC's The Morning Edition host Craig Norris.\n\nIt's no secret that mental health issues affect a lot of people, but it's not often that we see people, especially students, take time out of their day to help those affected.\n\n"It's a really personal subject to a lot of people, but there's a lot of stigma around it, so a lot of people don't want to talk about it," said Cui.\n\nSketchbook artwork from DepressionBot.
