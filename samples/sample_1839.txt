"As I said in my last post, I've spent the last few weeks working on the titular character from "Art Academy" - Ashley. She's a pretty complex character, and I've managed to complete her (as you can see from the pictures below). Just before I started drawing Ashley, I thought that it would be cool if I made her in the style of a Japanese anime or manga. I still think this was a good idea.\n\nI will probably update Ashley a little bit more, although I think she's complete now.
