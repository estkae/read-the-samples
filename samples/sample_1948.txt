The fund is used to “provide ICE with a source of funds to reimburse the costs of detention and removal,” according to an ICE document.\n\nIn a statement, ICE said that “all monies that are received are used to defray the expenses incurred while executing ICE’s mission.”\n\n“For example, money is used to pay for transportation of those in custody and to cover operational expenses at detention facilities and is used to offset detention costs for the states and localities that cooperate with ICE. ICE reimburses those jurisdictions for costs associated with the detention of criminal aliens in their custody,” the agency added.\n\nThe money also covers the salaries of the agents who arrest and detain people, the cost of obtaining travel documents, fees for public defenders, the cost of electronic monitoring, the cost of administering court proceedings and various other expenses, according to ICE.\n\n“ICE is in the business of immigration enforcement and detention, not deportations, and does not receive any taxpayer funding for the crucial work they do. On average, it costs between $50-75 per day to detain an individual,” ICE spokesperson Lori Haley said in a statement.\n\nICE seized $92 million in total from “a handful of” employers who illegally hired undocumented workers in 2018, according to CNN.\n\n“Funding for ICE is capped by Congress, and we can only ask for a fraction of what we need to do our job effectively,” ICE spokesperson Jennifer D. Elzea told The Washington Post in a statement. “We’re forced to make tough choices every day. It is not fair for individuals who violate our immigration laws to benefit from taxpayer dollars intended for law abiding citizens.”\n\nCongress does not set the amount that ICE can charge in wages or in seizing property.\n\nAccording to CNN, ICE seized $15 million from a family-run convenience store in California, $30 million from a Maryland construction company and $2 million from a plumbing business in Pennsylvania.\n\nAdvocates for immigrants and civil rights called on Congress to put an end to the practice.\n\n“ICE has repeatedly violated federal law and courts have repeatedly rebuked them for doing so,” Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, told The Post in a statement. “The money that ICE is seizing from immigrants is often the very money that is keeping them and their families off the street. These funds could be used to pay rent, put food on the table, or buy shoes for their children.”\n\n“Congress needs to put a stop to this abuse and pass the No Money for Deportation Act immediately,” he added.\n\nThe bill, introduced by Democratic Reps. Mark Pocan (Wis.) and Pramila Jayapal (Wash.), would prohibit ICE from seizing a person’s property “unless there is reasonable cause to believe that the property is subject to forfeiture and that the owner or person from whom the property was seized used the property in a manner that made it subject to forfeiture.”\n\nICE has long been criticized for going after the wages of undocumented workers.\n\nA 2011 report from the National Employment Law Project found that such programs had a “devastating effect on low-income families, separating mothers and fathers from their children, stripping them of their right to work and leaving them destitute.”\n\n“In fiscal year 2008, more than 15,000 workers and their families were denied more than $16.8 million in wages,” the report said.\n\nTrump made promises to crack down on illegal immigration during his campaign. But while illegal border crossings have decreased dramatically since he took office, his administration has embraced ICE as an agency dedicated to immigration enforcement.\n\nLast year, the administration authorized the agency to arrest more people without any criminal history and without first being given the authority by a judge.\n\nThe Post’s Maria Sacchetti reported that the agency “targeted 30 percent more people for deportation in the 2018 fiscal year than in the year before, with the biggest increase in immigrants who had committed no crimes beyond their immigration offenses.”\n\nBut the administration has also struggled with the long-term cost of detaining migrants. The cost of housing a migrant in a detention facility for a single day was estimated at $129 in 2017.\n\n“It’s a financial decision,” one Department of Homeland Security official told The Post in November. “The money is better spent elsewhere.”\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to accurately reflect ICE’s overall budget for fiscal year 2019. The agency’s budget is $7.3 billion.
