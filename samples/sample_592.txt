Diaper dermatitis in babies can be frustrating and difficult to manage. It is a condition that often occurs on babies with sensitive skin, and it is characterized by red, itchy rashes that can cause the baby to scratch. These rashes are the result of contact dermatitis, which can also be caused by substances such as chemicals, topical creams and other soaps. The irritation can be extremely bothersome to the baby, and the rash itself can be uncomfortable. In some cases, however, a rash may not be the result of diaper dermatitis. If the diaper rash does not respond to treatment or does not go away, it could be a sign that your baby has a more serious condition.\n\nDiaper dermatitis is an irritating and painful rash that can occur on the skin of a baby's diaper area. This condition can occur at any age and is characterized by red, itchy rashes that often become raw and develop a crusting appearance. Treatment typically involves the application of a topical cream, with limited success. Often, the rash does not respond to the cream or appears again the next time the baby wears a diaper. When this occurs, the diaper dermatitis is typically caused by a product in the baby's diet, such as a food or a topical cream.\n\nIf you have tried all kinds of different creams, but are still dealing with a diaper rash, it is possible that the rash is not caused by a diaper. Instead, it could be caused by a food allergy or an allergy to a topical cream. Both of these allergies can present as an irritating rash on the baby's diaper area. You can find out if the rash is caused by a food by eliminating the baby's diet one food item at a time and watching to see if the rash disappears. It is important to note that if the baby is lactose intolerant, the rash may clear up when you stop giving the baby any milk products, even if the allergy is not caused by a food.
