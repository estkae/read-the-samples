Firefox & X-windows: Gecko's built-in Xlib fallback is seriously broken. If you use the X display manager (startx) instead of the window manager, then Firefox will end up using Xlib instead of its native XRender support. This is apparently intended behavior to support people who have no X server, but the default configuration (which only tries XRender if you've enabled XRender support in the X server) is broken and results in every page turning red.\n\nFirefox & X-windows: Gecko's built-in Xlib fallback is seriously broken.

If you use GNOME, you can get the GNOME panel applet working in GNOME. If you use KDE, you can use this small [http://www.freerdp.com/wiki/doc/qtfx-kde.shtml KDE script]. Otherwise, to fix this problem, open the Firefox terminal and type {{ic|grep -A 1 -i Xorg Xorg.0.log}}. It should tell you exactly what's wrong and where it is in the log. For me it was a problem with a custom keyboard layout, a restart of X fixed it .\n\nIf you use Firefox with the X display manager, then there are two possible solutions to this problem.
