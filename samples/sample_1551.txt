Article : BTOB's Minhyuk's dirty-talking variety show 'Real Men' views on Youtube exceeded 1M Views... compared to Sechs Kies 'Real Men' views Source: Sports Donga via Naver 1. [+1,049, -77] As expected of a man who receives four times the hate a good man would get ㅠㅠㅠ Minhyuk-ah, let's get at least 10M views! ㅠㅠ 2. [+918, -79] Minhyuk's the best ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 3. [+735, -69] Let's hit 10M views, Minhyuk!! 4. [+626, -73] Minhyuk's actually good in variety ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ 5. [+503, -64] Even if you hate Minhyuk, you can't deny he's entertaining ㅋㅋ 6. [+84, -8] 1 million views in just over two days, he deserves to be a lead ㅋㅋㅋ 7. [+75, -11] I don't know if it's because he's funny but I always watch Minhyuk's episodes ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 8. [+64, -11] Is it because the three members don't do variety often? I'm sad that Minhyuk, Peniel, and Ilhoon are all the ones getting hate. So frustrating. 9. [+61, -8] I don't know why he gets so much hate, he's funny and has great variety skills 10. [+55, -5] Minhyuk's seriously good at variety shows ㅋㅋㅋ 1M views in a day, that's amazing ㅎㅎ 11. [+51, -7] Minhyuk's funny and has great variety skills ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 12. [+46, -7] I only watch Minhyuk and Peniel because they're the only two that are funny. Minhyuk's variety is good and Peniel has good impressions 13. [+40, -2] Minhyuk's one of the main MCs of Real Men. Ilhoon and Peniel only show up in the 100 episodes that aired in December. It's frustrating that Minhyuk has to take so much hate for that. They should've gotten Ilhoon in there as a member instead of giving Minhyuk all that hate. They're not doing Ilhoon any favors ㅜㅜ - Source: Nate 1. [+360, -9] Minhyuk's not perfect but he tries really hard ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 2. [+321, -14] Minhyuk's variety is good. I laughed at everything he did. 3. [+255, -13] As expected of Minhyuk... ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 4. [+21, -1] I thought he was popular before he joined the show but the hate I was reading surprised me... I think he's better off as a lead. 5. [+16, -0] It's hilarious that he gets a ton of hate for doing his job well ㅜㅜ He gets so much hate for being good at variety ㅜㅜ -\nArticle: 'Real Men' Minhyuk, "I know my weaknesses.

Let him sing and let's debut. 7. [+34, -2] Ah this isn't like the Minhyuk I know. He's good at variety, singing, and acting. He's got a bright and warm image too, no? 8.
