"The goal of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility of mapping poverty rates using simple statistical methods to improve upon existing efforts to do so. We found that the methods used to map poverty are based on population and economic data that were available to the Census Bureau as far back as 1960. While the full census decennial process now includes the collection of additional socioeconomic data, as well as improvements to administrative data, the basic steps required to produce a poverty map are the same. We have also demonstrated that alternative methods, such as an ordinary least squares regression method, provide estimates of poverty rates that are quite similar to the estimates produced by the method employed by the Census Bureau. The major difference is that the alternative method has the potential to be improved and more accurately used over time.
