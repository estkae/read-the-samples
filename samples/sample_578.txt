Just got back from the dealer.\n\n\n\nThe PRNAV info is stored in a table within the databases on the ECT. The PRNAV is built into the system on the cars but they can't offer it for the cheaper units as they can't change the unit to add it in.\n\n\n\nFor now they can either do a full ECT replacement for $700 or do a drivetrain swap that has the PRNAV for the same cost.\n\n\n\nThis was done with one of the systems for a different user and they can get one to work and offer it to others.\n\n\n\nA bit more expensive but at least it's available.\n\nCurrent:\n\n2015 Hyundai Genesis Sedan 3.8 AWD - 41,000 miles (more mods)\n\n2012 BMW 650i Coupe - 32,000 miles (retired)\n\n2001 Acura TL 5 Speed - 87,000 miles (retired)\n\n\n\nPrevious:\n\n2014 BMW 328xi Sedan 6 Speed - 38,000 miles (retired)\n\n2013 BMW 328xi Sedan 6 Speed - 12,000 miles (retired)\n\n2013 Ford Edge Sport AWD - 28,000 miles (retired)\n\n2006 BMW 325xi Sedan 6 Speed - 108,000 miles (retired)\n\n2005 Audi A4 3.2 Sedan 6 Speed - 126,000 miles (retired)\n\n2004 Toyota Prius - 130,000 miles (retired)\n\n2000 Ford Contour SE V6 - 215,000 miles (retired)\n\n1990 Ford Escort LX 5 Speed - 238,000 miles (retired)
