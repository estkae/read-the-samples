Stunning 180 degree views across south Edinburgh from the summit of Ben Lomond - one of the best in the country - to the distant Firth of Forth. This fantastic four-mile circuit of the mountain allows you to soak up all the views before making your way down via the Great Glen and the best path on the mountain - the Craig Munro Path.\n\nThe Walk: A circuit of Ben Lomond's western slopes from the summit car park. Distance: 6.2 miles. Ascent: 1390 feet.\n\nWe suggest you set off from the summit car park as early as possible to avoid any delays in reaching the summit, where the best views are to be had. The start of the walk is quite steep and the path undulates after that, but there are plenty of great views to be had all the way up.\n\nAt the summit you can enjoy the views - with the exception of the wind-blown top, there's nowhere else in the country where you can get such a complete panorama in one go - before heading off on the downhill section of the walk. The Great Glen path, although not a direct descent, is a lovely walk with a stream flowing down the middle. The Craig Munro path down to Craigleith is the most direct route, and as a path to an old gold mine it's well worth the effort!\n\nFor an alternative approach to Ben Lomond, check out the walk up Stuc a'Chroin.\n\nWalk information provided by Walk Britain.
