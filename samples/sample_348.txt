During the first year of life, children change more than they ever have before. At this stage, parents play an important role in influencing their child’s development.\n\nPregnant mothers are able to greatly influence the infant’s life in many ways. During pregnancy, a woman is able to optimize her diet and avoid environmental pollutants. Even while pregnant, it is important for her to stay healthy and happy, as this will in turn make the baby happier. All of this is important in a child’s development.\n\nBelow are five milestones in a baby’s development.\n\nMovement\n\nYour child has been feeling his own kicks and punches for a while now. He may have even kicked his mom and caused her some pain. The child will also be moving his arms and legs in a jerky fashion. As the baby grows, his movements will become more fluid.\n\nChild’s Hand and Finger Development\n\nBabies are able to grab things because their hands are strong. They are also able to curl their fingers into a fist. During this time, the baby may be grasping onto a lot of things that are near.\n\nThe baby may also have strong movements, such as pinching your fingers. Babies begin to explore their world through their hands. They are also able to control their hands and fingers with ease.\n\nSitting\n\nA baby can begin to sit up on his own. This is because he has grown to a point where he is able to do this. The baby may also be able to hold his head up by himself.\n\nBabbling\n\nThe baby may also begin to make sounds that can be referred to as babble. Babies are able to make a lot of sounds and combine them together. This is a part of speech development.\n\nFeeding\n\nYour child may be starting to eat solid food. This may include mashed vegetables, cereal, and baby food. If your baby is too young to eat this type of food, it may not be a good idea to force it. This can cause choking or other complications.\n\nSource: BabyCenter
