"Submission of the Month - April 2011\n\nStephanos\n\n18 years old, from the United States\n\nStephanos submitted this high school senior photo session and we're quite pleased with the results. Not only is the lighting well balanced, the background is well set, but more importantly, Stephanos' hair is on point. His hair in this shot is in a bit of a messy "bed-head" style, but it's what we're all looking for in our perfect senior portraits.\n\nStephanos, thanks for submitting this photo!\n\nVIEW MORE SUBMISSIONS
