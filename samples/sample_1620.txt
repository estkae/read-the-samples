Can’t beat the price for an at home iron. We just don’t use it as much as the reviews led me to believe we would. This iron is ok, not great, but it works for me. I was tired of running down to the ironing board and wanted to just be able to iron from my chair. The cord is only about 4 feet long, and that’s fine. I’m just ironing the face of my shirt, so I don’t need much. I don’t think it’s any worse than any other iron I’ve used, but I’m not one to notice much difference. The only thing that bothered me was that I had to fill it up with water, and I had to actually fill it almost the entire way. The water tank is pretty small, which is a little inconvenient for me, but it’s still fine. So far I haven’t noticed any water leaks or anything, so I’m hoping it’s fine"
