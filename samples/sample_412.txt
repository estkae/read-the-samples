"Unfortunately, in both cases the occupants were intoxicated. The first house we went into was this guy's.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's a look at the bar. The beer fridge was in the shed in the back.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's a bachelor pad without a recliner?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe back yard had a trampoline. That's all the beer this guy was going to need for a while.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we move to the house that had the party. There were lots of people at this house, and not a lot of time to take pictures. However, I did get a few that I think will give you an idea of the festivities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Docks!\n\nGood spot for the porta potty.\n\n\n\n\n\nWho's ready to rumble?!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe front lawn!\n\nGolf tournament!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen all was said and done, we had collected 8 trucks, a garbage truck, and a car from both houses.\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, and no injuries.\n\nThe general area of the party was right next to a creek. There were numerous signs saying how you would be arrested if you went in the creek. Well, as it turns out, there was a reason for those signs.Last year, the creek flooded, and one of the houses nearby was torn from its foundation and carried downstream. This was the home's fate.
