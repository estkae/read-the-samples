President Trump got into a heated exchange with CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta at his press conference on Thursday, calling the reporter “fake news” and challenging his network’s reporting.\n\nBut Trump’s son, Eric Trump, says the president will always be fair and give all reporters the time of day.\n\nIn an appearance on Fox News’ “Media Buzz,” Eric said Trump may attack CNN but always makes time for the network’s reporters.\n\n“[T]hey can still come in. The reporter that he did call on [at the press conference], we always give them an opportunity at every press conference. He’s always going to be fair,” he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“He’s always going to give them an opportunity, but we’re not going to let them take potshots at our president and our administration,” Eric Trump added.\n\nEric Trump also predicted that eventually the president will win the fight against “fake news” in the mainstream media.\n\n“My father is a fighter, and he’s an unbelievable person. I mean, he’s built an unbelievable business, and he’s built an unbelievable life. He’s a person that’s been elected to lead this country, and he’s going to do it with or without the media. He’s going to do it with or without certain networks. And it’s sad because he’s such a good man, and he’s such a good father,” Eric Trump said.\n\n“But at the same time, if they’re going to put themselves in a position where they’re going to be speaking so much, they’re going to continue to make mistakes,” he added.
