Paladin\n\nA paladin is the sworn defender of a group of creatures, a good-aligned organization, or a person. Most are deeply religious, but the few who aren't still serve their groups or causes with fanatical zeal. The paladin is essentially a warrior of the gods, and most spend their lives wandering the world of Oerth, aiding those they deem good or just. Although a paladin will fight to slay a horde of monsters or a mad king, he will not do so out of a lust for battle or destruction, but out of a need to keep the forces of darkness at bay.\n\nPaladins are renowned for their bravery, their unyielding dedication to the principles of good, and their mastery of martial arms. It is rare to find an evil paladin.\n\nAbilities: Strength and Charisma are both prime requisites for a paladin. Strength is his prime requisite, followed by Charisma. Strength governs how hard a paladin can hit, how effectively he can wear armor, and his carrying capacity. Charisma governs the strength of his spells and the DC's of his class skills. A paladin must be lawful good.\n\nHit Die: d10\n\nStarting Age: Complex.\n\nStarting Gold: Complex.\n\nClass Skills\n\nThe paladin's class skills are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (nobility and royalty) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), and Sense Motive (Wis).\n\nSkill Points at First Level: (2 + Int modifier) x 4.\n\nSkill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifier.\n\nClass Features\n\nAll of the following are class features of the paladin.\n\nWeapon and Armor Proficiency: Paladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).\n\nAura of Good (Ex): The power of a paladin's aura of good (see the detect good spell) is equal to her paladin level.\n\nDetect Evil (Sp): At will, a paladin can use detect evil, as the spell.\n\nSmite Evil (Su): Once per day, a paladin can call out to the powers of good to aid her in her struggle against evil. As a swift action, the paladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is evil, the paladin adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her attack rolls and adds her paladin level to all damage rolls made against the target of her smite. If the target of smite evil is an outsider with the evil subtype, an evil-aligned dragon, or an undead creature, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the paladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite evil attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.\n\nIn addition, while smite evil is in effect, the paladin gains a deflection bonus equal to her Charisma modifier (if any) to her AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the paladin targets a creature that is not evil, the smite is wasted with no effect.\n\nThe smite evil effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the paladin rests and regains her uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day, as indicated on Table: Paladin, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.\n\nDivine Grace (Su): At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.\n\nLay on Hands (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. Each day she can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 her paladin level plus her Charisma modifier. With one use of this ability, a paladin can heal 1d6 hit points of damage for every two paladin levels she possesses. Using this ability is a standard action, unless the paladin targets herself, in which case it is a swift action. Despite the name of this ability, a paladin only needs one free hand to use this ability.\n\nAlternatively, a paladin can use this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures, dealing 1d6 points of damage for every two levels the paladin possesses. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. Undead do not receive a saving throw against this damage.\n\nAura of Courage (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if she is unconscious or dead.\n\nDivine Health (Ex): At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.\n\nDivine Bond (Sp): Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin forms a bond with her god. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.\n\nThe first type of bond allows the paladin to enhance her weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a celestial spirit for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed light as a torch. At 5th level"
