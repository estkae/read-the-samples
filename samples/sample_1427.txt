the market didn't really understand that we could get this kind of a decline, until the actual data came out, there was a lot of surprise that the core came down so sharply\n\nhope this is your only selloff.\n\nlook, i don't like being over here on the short side because the bulls could always come back but i do want to be fair to my investors and keep them properly positioned.\n\nunfortunately, the data here is pretty much confirming the view we had about inflation, and the general view is it's just not going to get back to the 2% target as fast as people expected.\n\n, markets were taken by surprise by the drop in the consumer price index which came out yesterday, we actually thought the market wouldn't be able to handle it, but the market is able to handle it for now, but it's one of those things that creates uncertainty in the economy that keeps markets in check, even though we are oversold.
