RÃ©ponse de Marie et Eric :\n\nThe location of the house is really quiet and peaceful. We enjoyed sitting outside to have our meals in a lovely garden with shade. We found the house clean and tidy and we had a comfortable stay. We were surprised to be asked to sign a form in which we were given a list of things we weren't allowed to do during our stay. We do not believe that a list of things to do and not do should be put in the house rules. We can easily do without that. We are looking forward to visiting this region of France again.
