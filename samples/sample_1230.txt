Once again the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) has launched an Institute-specific call for proposals under the ACE programme. The Institute of Historical Research is the recipient of two of the four open-call prizes offered. Both are funded for 2 years and come with a research allowance of £10,000 per annum.\n\nThe first of these is entitled, ‘Contested Memories and the Place of Holocaust Memory in Europe’ and has been awarded to Dr Tobias Hochscherf (School of Advanced Study).\n\nThis proposal examines the place of the Holocaust in post-war Europe. It focuses on two interrelated questions. First, what happened to Holocaust memory as the Cold War unfolded in Central and Eastern Europe and second, how and why did it become acceptable to create memorials to Holocaust victims in the very same states which had been complicit in the Holocaust or had collaborated with the Nazis in occupied Poland? The funding is designed to enable a comparative analysis of the different trajectories of Holocaust memory in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Lithuania and Latvia. It will focus on a period from the late 1940s to the late 1960s and in particular on the period immediately following the Eichmann Trial (1961-62).\n\nThe second prize has been awarded to Professor Kevin Passmore (School of Advanced Study) and Dr Andrew Townsend (Department of History).\n\n‘Europe in Crisis: The Great War and the Arts and Humanities 1914-1918’ will focus on the interaction between the First World War and other fields, including literature, philosophy, politics, science and culture. It will also pay attention to gender, class and racial inequalities.\n\nThe focus of this proposal is threefold. First, it will explore the extent to which the war influenced cultural practices in Britain. Second, it will examine whether there was a distinctive ‘British’ experience of the war and, third, it will explore how the war affected the rest of Europe. It will examine such things as the popularity of war poetry and how this poetry differed between Britain and other European countries. It will also study the role of women and pacifists in both the Allied and Central Powers, while looking at the role of new technologies in European and especially British warfare.\n\nDr Jason Varitek, Director of the Institute of Historical Research said: ‘I am delighted that both the Faculty of History and the Institute of Historical Research have been successful in this prestigious call. They demonstrate the breadth of our expertise and the strength of our research. The Institute will now be seen as a centre for Holocaust research and, in the case of the first proposal, as a world centre for Holocaust memorials. The second proposal is particularly timely and the importance of this period for contemporary Europe should be obvious to everyone.’\n\nFurther details of both these projects and the other successful proposals are available on the AHRC website at: http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/media/newsevents/announcements/innovative_and_innovative_schemes/ace_prizes_awards_2011_2012/\n\nTwitter: @IHRKCL
