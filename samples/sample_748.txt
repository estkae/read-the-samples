... quite the colour wizard, haha. I think I made the colour choice pretty difficult for myself, but I love it and think it will look even better once it has a stain to it.\n\nThere's a lot more sanding to do. So far it's gone well and I can see the wood underneath but I haven't tried sanding yet. I guess I need to get some sandpaper!\n\nIt's going to look so great in our lounge, where we currently have two ratty old couches.\n\nHope you're all having a great weekend :)
