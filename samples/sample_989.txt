\n\nFor the first time in history a solar sail powered by fusion reactions, not solar radiation pressure, is successfully deployed. It is described as a first step toward a solar sail powered by fusion fuel.\n\nResearch has also been conducted on solar sails. However, the new design is intended to be practical in the near future, as it is expected to be able to reach speeds of up to 70,000 mph (11 km/s).\n\nResearch led by the Polytechnic Institute of Milan developed the solar sail, with funding from the Italian Space Agency (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana, or ASI). This new solar sail was launched on July 11, 2013. The testing is being conducted by the picosatellite, called “PicSat”, which was designed and built at the Polytechnic Institute of Milan. PicSat’s development was made possible thanks to a Ph.D. scholarship from the CNR-PRIN research project.\n\nThe picosatellite, PicSat, weighs around 1 kilogram and is about the size of a shoebox. The complete project cost about 100,000 Euro. It includes a solar sail to generate propulsion force as well as a scientific payload consisting of an on-board X-ray detector.\n\nThe solar sail, or “solar-radiation-pressure sail”, was successfully deployed during a 6 hour experiment on July 18th, 2013. The deployment took place during a deep-space simulation experiment on board the Ariane 5 rocket’s Fregat upper stage. Fregat is a three-stage solid-fueled orbital launch vehicle, with strap-on solid rocket boosters.\n\nThe solar sail consists of a multi-layer structure with a combined weight of about 1 kg. The structure is made of layers of polyimide, carbon, and quartz. The solar sail is about 3 square meters.\n\nThe sail is tethered to the picosatellite via a 2-meter tether. The picosatellite has onboard attitude control devices such as reaction wheels.\n\nThe objective of the experiment is to demonstrate that the solar sail is functional in space. It is a proof of concept. The experiment was successful, and it confirmed that the deployment of the sail was possible, and the sail was properly deployed. In particular, the sail was not damaged by the forces associated with the deployment, and the picosatellite remained functional.\n\nIt is expected that the picosatellite will continue its orbital mission for at least 6 more months. The onboard X-ray detector has the objective of measuring the dynamics of the solar wind in the earth’s vicinity, in particular, and investigate the “polar wind”.\n\nImage: PICOSAT: INAF-OAR’s new picosatellite was developed at the OAR (Istituto di Astrofisica e Planetologia Spaziali) of the INAF (Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica). PicSat will be operated by INAF-OAR. The project was launched by an Italian research council and funded by the Italian Space Agency (ASI) under contract with the Polytechnic of Milan. PicSat carries a payload in the form of an X-ray detector developed at the INAF-IASF Bologna, under the supervision of the INAF-OAR.\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nGoogle\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nTumblr\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments
