The Draw (soundtrack)\n\nThe Draw is the soundtrack album for the film "The Draw" (2000), starring Ryan Phillippe and Scarlett Johansson.\n\nWhile the film received a negative critical response, the soundtrack was well received.\n\nAfter production of the film wrapped in 1999, Gus Van Sant approached Brian Reitzell about composing the soundtrack for "The Draw". Reitzell had previously worked with Van Sant on "To Die For" (1995), for which he also acted as an assistant music editor. Van Sant later recalled that he enjoyed "the music [Reitzell] was making as a musician," and therefore hired him as the film's composer.\n\nThe soundtrack album was released on March 7, 2000, through Capitol Records. "The Draw" was the first soundtrack album on which Reitzell was credited as a composer. In the album's liner notes, he recalled, "I remember having to finish the film pretty quick and it being a rough cut when I first watched it." He added that he "didn't know what to do and [so] started recording pieces of it to see what [he] would come up with. As it came together, [he] started to think about how [he] could create an album around these soundscapes."\n\nFor the soundtrack album, Reitzell recorded approximately 45 minutes of instrumental tracks. "It was all just done in [Reitzell's] bedroom," according to Van Sant. Van Sant did not listen to"
