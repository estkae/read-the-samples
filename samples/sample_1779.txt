The only problem with this method is the lack of a cable to connect the PSoC to a computer. There is an option of programming the PSoC using a special serial device, but it's not a complete solution as far as interfacing the PSoC master with other hardware is concerned.\n\n\n\nAs far as the hardware platform is concerned, I think I have decided to use the Particle Photon. It's a development board that can be purchased in kit form (i.e. with a small, low power controller board called a "Core") or as a ready-to-go device. It is possible to upload sketches to the Photon using a Particle development environment that runs in a web browser and uses a cloud service to program the devices, which is an interesting approach that reduces the time and effort required to setup the development environment. The boards can be purchased online from the Particle web site. I'm still researching this option, but I'm leaning towards using the Photon due to the flexibility of the development environment.
