Worked for one day, then didn't charge.\n\nThis battery charged up for one day then wouldn't charge anymore. It said that it was plugged in but it wouldn't charge. It's supposed to charge while being used but not at all now. This was the only thing that I purchased from this company and I am very disappointed.\n\nVerified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
