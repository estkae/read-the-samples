Is there anything you would change about this book?\n\nIt's too long. I got bored. It's the wrong length for a book about the Crusades. I know you want to make it as comprehensive as possible, but let's face it, the Muslim perspective is the only one that matters. You can understand why people fought for this or that minor piece of territory, but you can't understand why they fought in the first place.\n\nHow would you have changed the story to make it more enjoyable?\n\nI wish they had done a better job of establishing the atmosphere of the time, instead of just going for sensationalism.\n\nHow could the performance have been better?\n\nThe narrator had a good voice for this.\n\nWas Crusade the right choice for you? Why or why not?\n\nNo, I'd never read about the Crusades before.
