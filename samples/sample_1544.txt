It was shaped like a boat, long and narrow, with a black head and stern, and in the middle, a moorish ridge of hill. A rocky shore encircled it, and from that shore, which broke the waters of the Pacific into clouds of tumbling foam, the island seemed to launch itself upon the sea, and to sail, with masts, and spars, and mainsail spread to the wind.\n\nThe kelpie lived in the shallows of the outer bay. He was a terrible horse-monster, and he came to shore every night to find what he could of food. He could speak, and had learnt a few human words, and he walked with a crab-like motion, sideways. His mouth was large, and full of teeth. His neck was long and swan-like, and he had the body of a horse, covered with shaggy hair. His hoofs were three-clawed, like a bird's.\n\nThere was a long, narrow bay on the seaward side of the island, which was full of fish, and the kelpie came up that bay to eat them. And there was a girl called Martha who lived in a little house on the shore.\n\nMartha lived all alone. Her mother had died when she was a baby, and her father, who was a sailor, had gone to sea when she was still little.\n\nHe never came back. He was lost at sea, and nobody knew whether he was alive or dead.\n\nSo Martha lived in the house alone, and was glad to have no relations, and she did not care if they did not come and see her.\n\nWhen she was very small she used to see the kelpie in the shallows. He frightened her. She was only six years old when she was sent to school. The school was in the village which was on the other side of the island. She was not afraid of the kelpie then, because he did not come to the school. And her cousins came to see her every Sunday, and she was always happy when they were there.\n\nBut they went away, one by one, to go to the High School, and at last only two of them came to see her every Sunday. One was Thyra, her cousin, who was a year younger than herself, and the other was Angus, who was her cousin, too, and was ten years older.\n\nAngus was her father's cousin. He was a tall man, with yellow hair and blue eyes, and his face was weather-beaten. He wore a fisherman's jersey and a pea-jacket. He was the man of all others whom Martha liked to see, and he was the only man she could see every Sunday.\n\nAngus and Thyra used to take Martha to church every Sunday, and afterwards they would sit down to tea.\n\nBut when Martha was nine years old the kelpie came up into the bay, and he stopped behind the fisherman's houses, where the rocks came to the edge of the sea, and there he made a nest of seaweed.\n\nIt was in a cleft of the rocks. The nest was round and deep, and was so strong that you could not pull it to pieces.\n\nIn the middle of the nest was a hole. This was the door of the nest. The kelpie used to sleep inside the nest.\n\nMartha was too young to go to church alone. And she liked to stay at home, for she was always hoping that her father would come back, and she did not want to go to church without him.\n\nSo she was at home every Sunday, and she used to sit at the window and watch the sea.\n\nOne Sunday Angus and Thyra came to the house as usual.\n\nThey brought a message from the minister, who was the clergyman at the village. The minister had a good voice and sang beautifully. He sang in the choir, and sang the tenor. And he loved Martha's father. He loved him, and he loved his little girl. He was a man who thought of others.\n\nAnd he had sent Martha a message, which Angus and Thyra had brought from him.\n\nHe wanted Martha to come to church every Sunday with them, so that he could talk to her and teach her and make her a good girl.\n\nBut Martha could not go. She told them why.\n\n'I am very sorry,' said the minister's message, 'but the minister is obliged to have an assistant to help him, and I want to take your father's place as the assistant minister of the parish. I must ask you to come to church every Sunday. I will come over to see you in the afternoon, and we will read the Bible together, and you will come to me on Monday morning for a lesson. It is my duty to help you. Please obey me.'\n\n'I am very sorry,' said the minister's message, 'but I have to do what the minister says. Please obey him.'\n\nSo Martha was obliged to go.\n\nThe next Sunday she went to church with Angus and Thyra. And after church the minister came to see her. And he came every Sunday afternoon, and read the Bible to her, and on Monday he came at nine o'clock to give her a lesson.\n\nHe used to give Martha a Bible-lesson every day, and it was very good for her, for the minister was a clever man, and he taught her well.\n\nShe learnt the New Testament in the Bible by heart. She was not a clever girl, and the minister had to tell her to do it over and over again.\n\nShe learned the Ten Commandments by heart, and the catechism, and the little prayer-book that the minister had given her, with prayers in it which every good child had to know by heart.\n\nIt was a long time before the minister began to teach Martha anything new. But at last he thought that she was old enough.\n\nSo one Sunday afternoon he took her to the top of a little hill which was above the village.\n\nIt was the very highest point of the island, and was bare of trees, and the sea was round about it.\n\nThe minister showed Martha all the isles of the sea, and she looked over a great distance to where the mainland was, and the mountains and the sky, and she felt happy.\n\nThe minister was very happy, too, for he loved his parish.\n\nHe loved Martha, and he loved his work.\n\nHe told her many things about God, and about his work in the parish.\n\nBut when he had been there with her for a little while, and had finished what he had to say, he told Martha that she must now kneel down, and she must pray to God to help her.\n\nShe was surprised, for she had not expected this, and she had never prayed.\n\n'What shall I say?' she asked the minister.\n\n'You must thank God for giving you a good father, who was a Christian, and who taught you to read the Bible,' he said. 'You must thank God that you were so young when your father died that you could remember him. You must ask God to make you like your father, and you must pray that you will be good.'\n\nSo Martha kneeled down, and she thanked God for giving her a good father, and she asked God to make her like her father, and she prayed to God to make her good.\n\nAnd after that she went home, and the minister came the next day, as usual.\n\nShe could not go to church again with Angus and Thyra, because she had to be at home every Sunday afternoon, and she had to have her Bible-lesson every day.\n\nShe thought that she would not mind. She liked the minister, and he had been very kind to her.\n\nBut she found that she missed going to church.\n\nShe used to sit at the window and look across the sea, and the time seemed very long when she had no one to talk to but the minister, and no one to play with but the minister.\n\nAnd although the minister was good and kind, he was not very merry.\n\nHe was an old man, and he had little sense of fun, and he had a trick of remembering little things which he did not like.\n\nSo that Martha used to have a sort of melancholy feeling when she was at home with him.\n\nAnd after that she did not like being alone so much as she had done.\n\nSometimes she used to sit on the rocks by the sea, and she thought of her father, and she wished that
