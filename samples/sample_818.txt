No, this isn’t a holiday season complaint from your kids, “Santa isn’t real!” This is a history lesson about a different mythical creature.\n\nWe’ve all heard about vampires. They usually stay in castles. They’re sometimes in France.\n\nBut did you know that before they were vampires, they were werewolves? Werewolves are even worse because they transform into monsters during the full moon!\n\nIt may surprise you to know that werewolves were quite popular in European folklore. People would sometimes actually dress up as werewolves, as part of a holiday. They would often run through the streets of a town, harassing people and destroying property.\n\nSome historians have suggested that the werewolf legends are actually a way of explaining the reality of mental illness. Ironic, because mental illness is often more difficult to cure than an infection by a vampire or a werewolf.\n\nIf you’re looking for an interesting holiday season, go to a werewolf re-enactment. If you’re lucky, you might even catch a glimpse of a werewolf.\n\nWhat would you do if you caught a werewolf? Let us know! We’re glad to discuss all the latest werewolf movies, books and legends!
