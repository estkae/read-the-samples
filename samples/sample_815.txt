PDA View Full Version : VoLTE Ready for Samsung Galaxy S7 Sprint Savy COLD WEATHER UPDATE! Due to the extreme temperatures experienced in the US over the last few weeks and the impact to shipping, we were not able to deliver our regular monthly build to our Sprint customers on Jan. 4th.\n\n\n\nSince then, we have delivered VoLTE updates for our Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge customers. These devices are now ready for use with VoLTE.\n\n\n\nWe have also started to roll out the monthly update to our Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge customers with VoLTE enabled. The remaining devices (S6 Active and S6 Duos) will receive VoLTE updates starting in the next few weeks.\n\n\n\nDue to these changes, we will be extending the Android 5.1.1 rollout to the Samsung Galaxy S5 and HTC One M9 on a 4-week schedule. We will begin pushing these updates the week of February 9, 2016.\n\n\n\nIf you own a Samsung Galaxy S5 or HTC One M9, you can check if your phone is ready for VoLTE by heading to your device settings menu and looking for VoLTE near the top of the list. If you do not see VoLTE in the menu, you will need to wait a few weeks for the next update.\n\n\n\nThank you for your patience during this time. We will provide another update with more details about this change by the end of this month. Your patience is appreciated as we work to provide VoLTE service to our customers.\n\n\n\nSprint Savy Hey Guys, due to the cold weather we have encountered several issues with our Samsung models. We have started to push updates to our Samsung models and we hope to have everyone back up and running shortly.
