Taken 3 is on its way to a theater near you, but this time around, Neeson’s on a quest for vengeance after his wife is killed in a terrorist attack, leading him to a retired CIA operative named Shaw, whose wife was also killed in a terrorist attack. Together, the two set out to track down the men responsible for their respective loved ones’ deaths.\n\nI know it sounds like Taken 3 is just Taken with an extra number tacked on the end, but the first trailer for the film does a solid job of setting up this particular story. The biggest takeaway is that Taken 3 is actually the third movie of a series that was clearly meant to be a one-off. If you’re going to take a character, kill his wife, and make him a vengeance-fueled killing machine, at least give him a different set of friends to rely on. It just doesn’t make sense to rely on an old CIA operative in the third installment.\n\nI’m curious to see how this plays out. The marketing campaign is really on-point here, as it’s certainly paying homage to Taken while playing into its strengths as a big budget action movie. What I’m wondering is whether or not Taken 3 will feature the same chemistry between Neeson and his daughter that we saw in the first two films. Or whether the chemistry of the new buddy cop story will be what pushes this film over the top.\n\nEither way, I think Taken 3 is going to be fun. Here’s the official synopsis:\n\nAnchored by Neeson’s undeniable screen presence, Taken 3 continues the ex-CIA operative’s adrenaline-fueled pursuit to save his daughter from the clutches of a murderously determined abductor.\n\nAs for Neeson, he’s been quite busy in 2014. He’s appeared in three different films this year alone: Non-Stop, A Walk Among the Tombstones, and now Taken 3.\n\nTaken 3 opens in theaters on March 5, 2015.
