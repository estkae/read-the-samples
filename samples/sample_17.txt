But I do find it quite uncomfortable seeing them."\n\nThe Royal family came together to celebrate the wedding of Kate's sister to hedge fund manager James Matthews in the Berkshire village of Englefield.\n\n(Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAnd while Pippa and James' wedding was a private affair with just 200 guests, they were still surrounded by some royals as well as other notable names.\n\nLady Amelia's father is the Queen's first cousin, so it was no surprise to see the Queen herself attend the wedding, alongside Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan.\n\nThe Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie were also there, as well as Kate's sister, Pippa's brother James Middleton, David and Victoria Beckham and Sir Elton John.\n\nLady Amelia revealed that she even had a few words with Harry and Meghan, with the former asking her how she felt about her cousin's big day.\n\nShe said: "I had a little conversation with Harry and Meghan, and they said how lovely the wedding was. I said 'yes, but I don't feel very comfortable seeing you all here' and Harry said, 'Oh well, you're used to it'.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n"I said, 'Yes, but it is still very strange to see you here'. I suppose you can't blame me, I am a bit naive. But the whole thing was really lovely."\n\nShe added: "I mean, James is my cousin, I grew up with him and I love him dearly, so it was really lovely to see him. It was a lovely wedding, they are such a lovely couple. I am so pleased they are so happy."\n\n(Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\n(Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\nAnd as for what she thought of her father's outfit - which caused much comment among fans - she admitted she wasn't sure.\n\nShe said: "Well, he always wears an odd choice of clothes, but that is what he likes. It wasn't bad, I mean he didn't look like a big prawn."\n\nShe added: "It was lovely to see him happy."
