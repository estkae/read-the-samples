If your personal philosophy is a little bit Taoist and a little bit Marxist, there's a new place in LA to scratch that particular philosophical itch. Tao Mao is the only East-meets-West neo-communist tiki bar in LA, a three-story Chinatown bordello of poi dogs and palm trees. To get there, you enter from a rear alley and walk past the washboard abs of dancers in the Bumpin' Uglies Go-Go Bar to the karaoke bar called Red 7, and from there climb a red-lit staircase to the restaurant.\n\nTao Mao, "the great origin," is the Chinese name for the Milky Way galaxy, as seen from the Earth.

For example, I met two TV writers who were there for the first time. The owner was there with his mom. The first time I visited, the woman in the next booth to me was there with her sister, and"
