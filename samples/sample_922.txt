In an op-ed for The Hill published Monday, National Rifle Association (NRA) board member Ted Nugent argued that if President Obama is reelected, "it will be time to vandalize, intimidate, harass, and maybe hurt" Democrats.\n\nNugent also claimed that Democrats "and their media enablers," and "anti-gunners" would be held responsible for any violent acts perpetrated by Second Amendment supporters.\n\nHis remarks were a reaction to an open letter by the Secret Service published in The Hill last week that warned campaign staffers and volunteers to avoid confronting voters at polling stations on Election Day.\n\nThe letter came after a Nevada Republican poll watcher claimed she had been threatened by a Democratic observer on the day of the state's GOP caucuses.\n\n"Agents and officers will continue to maintain a high level of visible presence at and around your campaign offices, in the community, and at your events to provide you with the necessary protection you require to feel safe on Election Day," wrote Pia Carusone, assistant to the director of the Secret Service.\n\nNugent took issue with the Secret Service's concerns in his op-ed, arguing that they were "typical of our dastardly, dishonest enemies who would never call a bluff on their lies and deceit. And this is why the Secret Service's recent letter to the Nevada GOP, which recently stated that the Service would not protect them from a known danger to their safety, is completely unacceptable."\n\n"The day after a second Obama election, it will be time to turn the tables," he continued. "It will be time to deny Obama and his cronies the privilege of anonymity. It will be time to stigmatize the lawless Obama minions in the public square."\n\n"If they won't answer the call to service when they are needed to protect the life of an American president, perhaps they will respond to the call to service when they are needed to protect the American public from a runaway president," he added.\n\n[H/T: Media Matters]
