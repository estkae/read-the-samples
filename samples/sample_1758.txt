I don't know, so don't ask.\n\nAnyways, this is my first official original story, and I've been meaning to post it for a while. Enjoy.\n\nI woke up with the sunlight pouring into my eyes, a low groan leaving my lips as I rolled onto my side, my arm finding a warm, soft body. I smiled to myself as I closed my eyes and laid there for a minute, remembering the events from the night before.\n\nJust over a year ago, I was a very different man. I had a wife, three kids, a job, and a house. Now, I am a one-man rebellion, fighting for the rights of the genetically impaired.

I leaned over and gave her a kiss on the cheek, then stood up. "I'll call you soon."\n\nI walked into the main room of the suite, not waiting for her reply. I laid down on the couch and waited for her to come to the door. A few minutes later, I heard it slam shut. I rolled over and looked at the TV.
