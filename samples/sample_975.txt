Like Highway 401, the older parts of Highway 35 have a number of "radial" or "X" junctions that have two right angle turns.\n\nHighway 35 does not use its posted 80 km/h speed limit here, despite the fact that it is surrounded by residential neighbourhoods and light industrial uses. In fact, this is not a place where you would expect to find a speed limit sign at all, as you would expect that no one would need to be reminded to drive slowly. The posted speed limit here is actually 30 km/h, but of course no one drives at that speed.\n\nThe guardrail in this photo is on a rather short stretch of highway here, as soon the highway meets the Canadian National Rail line.\n\nHighway 35 ends at Kipling Avenue in Toronto. From there, drivers can access Highway 427, an eight lane freeway which spans both the city of Toronto and the Regional Municipality of York. Highway 427 is the next page.\n\nPhotographed by Sean Bradley.\n\nPage Added June 23, 2001.\n\nChanges to page July 24, 2008.\n\nThis section of Highway 35 was covered in the book "Highway 35: From the Heart of the City to the Garden of the Country" published by James Lorimer & Company.
