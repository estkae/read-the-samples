"Spare Time Cribbage Rules\n\nHow to Play Cribbage\n\n\n\nLearn Cribbage rules\n\nThe most popular variation of the Cribbage game is the two player version.\n\nPlayers sit opposite each other and play two games. A typical cribbage game is 12 to 18 hands.\n\nEach player is dealt six cards in batches of three.\n\n\n\nThe Cribbage Board\n\nCards are played to the board by counting the number of points to be scored for a specific card. The numbers are marked on the board by the numbers 1 to 15 in ascending order.\n\nThere is an arrow, called the "point," above the number 15. This arrow can be slid along the board to point at the score that needs to be scored.\n\nThe board has two vertical lines, each with two smaller lines:\n\nThe line on the left is used to keep track of the running total of the score.\n\nThe line on the right is used to keep track of the total number of points scored.\n\n\n\nScoring\n\n\n\nThe aim of the game is to reach 121 points.\n\nThe score of a card can be obtained by counting the pips on the card. The pips are counted on both sides of the card. The picture of the card is also counted as a pip.\n\nEach card score has a point value, from 2 points for a two, up to 15 points for a king, queen or jack. The king, queen and jack are each worth a score of five points.\n\nAces are worth 1 point, the rest of the cards are worth their pips.\n\nFor example, a 7 card is worth seven points, the two of clubs is worth two points, and the three of clubs is worth three points.\n\nThe total of a hand is always the total of the cards, plus the point value of any cards that are played to the board.\n\n\n\nThe Deal\n\nThe dealer is decided randomly.\n\nThe non-dealer shuffles the deck of cards.\n\nThe dealer deals six cards to each player in batches of three.\n\nThe remaining cards are placed face down in the middle of the table. This pile of cards is called the "stock."\n\nThe top card from the stock is turned over and placed on the top of the stock. This card is called the "upcard."\n\nAt the start of the game, the two players take turns to play cards to the board, in turn.\n\n\n\nIn Cribbage, it is possible to "cut the pack" when the stock is depleted.\n\nCutting the pack means the player cuts the pack into two. The player cuts the stock at any point between the upcard and the bottom card in the pack.\n\nWhen cutting the pack, the player does not shuffle the cards after the cut, but rather the two halves are placed in the two player's hands.\n\nAfter a cut, play continues in a similar manner to the usual method of dealing and playing cards.\n\nA player who cuts the pack at the start of the game, is also the dealer for the second game.\n\nPlayers who have played with a standard pack of cards will probably notice that the order of the cards is slightly different from the usual order. This is because the pack is cut differently, and because the upcard is placed on the top of the stock at the start of the game.\n\nWhen one player plays all his cards, the game is over.\n\nThe score can be calculated and the player with the highest score is the winner.\n\n\n\nGame End\n\nWhen both players have exhausted their hands, the player with the lowest total points is the winner.\n\nIn case of a tie, the winner is the player who has made more pairs.\n\nIf there is still a tie, then the player with more runs is the winner.\n\nIf there is still a tie, the game is a tie.\n\n\n\nCribbage Rules\n\nThere are a number of other scoring combinations in the Cribbage game, in addition to the pairs and runs.\n\nThey are explained on the Cribbage Rules page.\n\nThe object of Cribbage is to be the first player to reach 121 points, or more points than the opponent.\n\nPlayers who are more familiar with standard playing cards may find it easier to learn to count Cribbage points from the point values on the standard playing card pips.\n\n\n\nCribbage game variations\n\nSome people play the game using the "five up" rule. This means the first card that is laid out on the table scores five points, not four.\n\nMany people, however, prefer to use the "two up" rule. This means the first card that is laid out on the table scores two points, not four.\n\nSome people play the game in a similar manner to the two up rule, but only score two points for an ace.\n\nOther people play the game in a similar manner to the two up rule, but score six points for an ace.\n\nThere are also a number of other variations of Cribbage rules.\n\nThere is a popular alternative to the traditional Cribbage board.\n\nThe alternative board uses the same numbered cards to form a playing card.\n\nA traditional Cribbage board uses an arrow to show the score, whereas the alternative board uses the same numbered card as the score.\n\nAn alternative board is shown at the bottom of this page.\n\nThe alternative board is simply laid out with no arrow.\n\nSome people prefer this alternative to the traditional cribbage board, as it has less clutter and easier to keep track of the score.\n\nThe rules are the same for the traditional cribbage board and the alternative board.\n\nThe alternative board does, however, make it a little harder to keep track of the total points scored.\n\nSpare Time Cribbage\n\nSpare Time Cribbage is a single deck Cribbage variation.\n\nThis game is played on a traditional cribbage board, and is sometimes called "Crib."\n\nA standard pack of 52 cards is used.\n\nThe game is played in two "spare time" games. The first game is 12 hands long.\n\nThe second game is 10 hands long.\n\nThe loser of the first game is the first player to play the first hand in the second game.\n\n\n\nAces and 2s are worth 1 point, all other cards are worth their face value.\n\nThe game is played in three turns. Each player plays two cards to the board in each turn.\n\nAfter each player has played two cards, the player with the lowest card scores two points. This continues until both players have played all their cards.\n\nThe first game is played to a total of 61 points.\n\nThe winner of the first game is the first player to score 61 points.\n\nThe loser of the first game scores nothing.\n\nIf the loser of the first game reaches 61 points, the winner of the first game scores nothing.\n\nIn the second game, the winner of the first game scores 2 points.\n\nThe loser of the first game scores nothing.\n\nThe second game is played to a total of 41 points.\n\nThe first player to reach 41 points, or more, is the winner.\n\nIf both players reach 41 points, the winner is the player with the most points.\n\nIf there is a tie, the first player to reach 61 points, or more, is the winner.\n\nThe winner of the second game scores 2 points.\n\nThe loser of the second game scores nothing.\n\n\n\nWe are always looking for variations and improvements to Cribbage rules.\n\nIf you know of an alternative method of playing Cribbage,\n\nor if you have a suggestion for an improvement to the Cribbage rules,\n\nplease let us know.\n\n\n\nVisit our Cribbage Rules page\n\nThere is also a page about counting cribbage points and keeping track of cribbage scores.\n\n\n\nThere is a page that describes the origins of Cribbage.\n\n\n\nSome people who like Cribbage also enjoy playing Euchre.\n\nThere is a description of Euchre rules and variations.\n\n\n\nSome people also enjoy playing Gin Rummy.\n\nThere is a description of Gin Rummy rules and variations.\n\n\n\nVisit our Online Dice game to play dice games online.\n\nThere is a page with tips for playing the dice game and strategies for playing dice.\n\nThere is also a page that describes the origins of the dice game.\n\n\n\nCopyright | Privacy Policy | Disclaimer | Contact | Copyright Notice\n\n\n\nÂ© 2005-2019 http://www.SpareTimeGames.com\n\nAll Rights Reserved
