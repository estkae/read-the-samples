Self Portrait was a virtual representation of one of Ratonhnhaké:ton's genetic memories, relived by Desmond Miles in 2012 through the Animus.\n\nContents show]\n\nDescription Edit\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton was getting dressed when he heard the sound of barking. Worried that the guards were alerted to his presence, he exited the room, only to find a domesticated wolfdog.\n\nDialogue Edit\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (frightened) Who's there?\n\nThe wolfdog growled.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Shush!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (calming) Hush!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Good boy.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Now, where'd you come from?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: What a curious creature.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: You are one of the villagers' pets, no?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: The closest village is east of here.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: And they keep you locked up, like an object?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: That is not right.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I will take you where you can run free.\n\nThe wolfdog barked and followed Ratonhnhaké:ton.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: There, now.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Out of here, boy.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: We need to be quick.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Come on!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I have a plan, but I cannot do this alone.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: You will help me, won't you?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I have a job for you.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Good boy.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I am going to distract the guards.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: You must go out the back door, and fetch help.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: There are warriors who are eager to prove themselves.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: They are in the forest to the south.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Go now!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I'll distract them!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: There's a way out this way!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: What?\n\nThe wolfdog growled and rushed past Ratonhnhaké:ton.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Oh, well.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Guess I'm not alone after all.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: But we are two, and they are many!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: If you'll give us some cover, we can...\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (sighing) It was worth a try.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I'll hold them off, but you need to fetch help.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: You remember the warriors in the forest, yes?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Go!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: No, you're not leaving me here!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: You can come with me, or fetch help, but you are not leaving me here.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I have an escape route.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Follow me!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Good dog!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: The steps are there, come!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Come on!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: What are you waiting for?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Good dog.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: A woman!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: How did she get in here?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Who is she?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Can she help us escape?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (startled) Is that you?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Are you a wolf?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: What are you doing here?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: If you want to leave with me, we need to move!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: We need to be quick!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (giggling) You'll protect me, yes?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Yes, yes.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Oh, it's so dark!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: There must be a way out!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: There are, but I cannot see where they lead!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: You could sniff them out.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Good boy!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Oh, no!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: He's blocking our escape!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: There has to be a way around!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Perhaps if we avoid him, we can escape!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: No!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Wait!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (sighing) They are everywhere!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I don't know if we can get out of here.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (startled) There are more of them!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (sighing) I do not think I can defeat them alone.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: You have the smell of the forest on you.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: You must lead the others to us!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Find the warriors and bring them to us!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I will do everything in my power to keep them distracted.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: You know the way.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Good dog!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (yelling) Come on, we're waiting!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Where are the warriors?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (growling) What is that sound?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: It is coming from above!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Is this the help you've brought?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (growling) No, it cannot be!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Good dog!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (yelling) That way!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I think the warriors have arrived!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (yelling) We need your help!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Come on!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: No, I said that way!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (yelling) Where are you going?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Come back!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: There is no need to be so rude!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Who are you?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (startled) A bear?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I had a wolf for a companion.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: You can see him outside.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (surprised) Another dog?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: That one is not as friendly as yours.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: What are you doing here?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: How can you be here?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: They are ready to attack, you must distract them!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Good dog!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: He can help me, I just need to get him outside!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I cannot leave without the other!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Do not be a fool!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: He's too heavy!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: You have to help me.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (yelling) Leave him and go!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: It is too late!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: We are doomed!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: They're moving too fast!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: How can you be so calm?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: They will kill us!
