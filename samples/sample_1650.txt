So I have a new kitchen counter now that is solid wood, no more laminate. Very nice, except that I don't want to put the caulk gun on it, and I have a new colander that I want to stick into the sink, but it is too heavy to use with my usual suction cup colander holder. A regular one with a handle would work, but then I would need a magnet to hold it, and I thought why not put a magnet on the side of the new colander. It works very well, and the only problem is the handle. It is painted wood, so it doesn't hold the magnet as well as metal, but it does hold it. It isn't glued or anything, I just hold it with my finger tips, which are pretty strong. And, I just found out that my Wusthof has a magnet in the bottom, so I may stick that in the sink. I used the colander that I was using, and as I said, I just hold it in place, I don't put the magnet on the colander itself. You can see in the pic that I have a red rubber thing to protect the wood and make a little ledge for the colander to sit on, so it doesn't sink into the wood. It will last a long time, and will come off easily, so I can replace it when the need arises. A great idea that I picked up on Food Network (while on the exercise bike).\n\n\n\nAnd, I think the saying is "never put off until tomorrow what you can do today". I started by looking for the magnet that I use on the metal lip of the sink in my kitchen in Colorado, then the fridge, etc. It was not where I thought it should be, so I decided to do it now, rather than spend more time looking. And, I got to use my new waffle maker and got the advantage of the break in, I got to break it in, so now I know how it will work for me, and it is going to work great!\n\n\n\nKathleen
