BOOM!! 10 years of Brikk Fast! Wow, time sure flies when you are having fun, making things, and working hard. Brikk Fast has changed a lot over the years, and has become much more than we ever thought it would. The staff at Brikk Fast has grown, we've brought on some awesome employees that have become just as much a part of the Brikk Fast family as we have. In 2010, we opened up a storefront, and that has allowed us to expand on all the wonderful things we do, and the way we do them. This year we've grown a lot as a company, in ways both great and small. As a company we've become much more involved in the local community, with events and fundraisers"
