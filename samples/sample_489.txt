Shepard and his team have done it again. I've been a fan of "American Chopper" since day one. I used to get angry with Paul Sr. for the way he treated the guys but I guess that was part of the show's draw. I have never seen a father and son fight like that on TV before. I still hope he comes back someday to work with his son, and they can rebuild the relationship they had before. I can't say enough good things about this season of American Chopper, with all the good work the team did for cancer patients, this is one of the most memorable seasons of the series.\n\nThe creativity of the builds is incredible. I'm so glad that they were able to get the Ford back on the road after the fire. They did an amazing job on the bike itself and the amount of work they put into making sure everything was functional on the bike, even the brakes, was inspiring. The customization they did on the ambulance was pretty impressive as well, especially how they made sure all the hydraulic and electrical components worked correctly. I also loved the idea of doing a bike with a hunting theme and the amount of work they put into making the motorcycles look like they belonged to an entire hunting party was great. They did an amazing job on the bike that played homage to the military and even the Great American motorcycle show was awesome! The barber shop bike and "Appalachian Outlaw" motorcycle were just as awesome. The personal touches that were put on these bikes really made them so much better.\n\nI know a lot of people criticize the shows for not showing the whole building process, but in my opinion, I like to see the creativity that the builders put into the bikes. The shows are a lot more enjoyable when I see what goes on in their heads when they come up with their ideas.
