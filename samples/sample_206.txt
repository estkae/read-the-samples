More than 600 students in the CSU system are waiting for their transcripts to be cleared.\n\nTranscripts at CSU campuses are frozen for over 600 students who attended the Pueblo campus last semester, and if they don't complete their credits and final exams, they could lose their scholarships and their seats.\n\nAccording to the CSU-Pueblo website, 615 students have not yet completed their spring semester. They will lose their financial aid eligibility if they don't finish.\n\n"It's like they're on a waiting list," said Dale Lange, who works at the registrar's office. "We're waiting for the teachers to grade their finals and the professor to submit the grades and then they can release the transcript."\n\nOn March 20, the Pueblo campus was told to cease instruction and close by the chancellor's office.\n\n"It's just horrible," said CSU-Pueblo student Julea Prentice. "I don't know if I'm graduating or not."\n\nPrentice said she's upset she's paying for classes that she can't use, but she feels she doesn't have a choice.\n\n"If I want to go to graduate school I have to get a certain GPA, so I can't afford to fail this semester," said Prentice.\n\nMeanwhile, her son is suffering because he needs a caretaker for his medical condition.\n\n"That's why I'm a mother, that's why I'm a mom, that's why I'm a father," said Prentice.\n\nPrentice said she feels alone and doesn't know what to do.\n\n"If I don't have an answer, I can't do anything," said Prentice. "I just have to wait."\n\nIt's a wait-and-see game for CSU students.\n\n"I just hope we all pass," said Prentice.\n\nSome students, like Adrienne Longoria, have called out for help.\n\n"Help us," she said. "Help us students."\n\n"We would have probably been able to catch up if they had let us finish our classes," said Longoria. "It's just frustrating that they can't let us finish our last few weeks."\n\nLongoria and Prentice said they want to go to graduate school, but if they don't pass this semester, they could lose their scholarships.\n\n"I'm trying to be hopeful," said Prentice.\n\n"It's frustrating, but I don't know what to do," said Longoria. "I'm hoping we get our money back and I'm hoping we can finish this semester."\n\nCSU-Pueblo officials said they don't know when transcripts will be released because each student's professor has to grade the final exams and send them to the registrar's office.
