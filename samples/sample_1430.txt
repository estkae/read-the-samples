As I walked along a footpath one summer day in 2011, the sparrows scattered into the long grass and weeds of a field. As I looked up, I saw the cause of their alarm.\n\nIt was a day so still that the heat seemed to be shimmering. In the distance I saw a flock of sheep being driven across a field by their shepherd. There was a small horse trotting along beside the sheepdog. Then, from the direction of the sheep came a larger dog, looking bigger and bigger as it ran, jaws open.\n\nWhen the dog was almost on top of the sheep and the shepherd, it dropped its head and took a bite at the nearest sheep. It jumped back to the ground and watched the shepherd move the sheep away from the horse. Then the dog came back for another bite.\n\nWhen the shepherd had moved the sheep away, the dog stayed where it was, watching the shepherd and the sheep as they moved further away, the horse following them. It waited, jaws open, for a long time.\n\nThen it turned and ran off across the field and out of sight.
