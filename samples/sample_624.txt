"Source\n\nOnly one out of ten lawyers in Europe’s biggest economies have reached their retirement age. The average age at which European lawyers leave the profession is 60. The problem of the age distribution of lawyers in Europe is particularly serious in Spain (only one out of five lawyers will reach retirement age), but is also a concern in France (35%), Germany (39%), Italy (42%) and the UK (45%). On the other hand, Belgium (59%), Austria (61%), Luxembourg (62%), the Netherlands (63%), Finland (64%) and Ireland (68%) are the countries where lawyers retire later.\n\nIn the past decade the situation in Europe has deteriorated as the number of lawyers over 50 has increased by more than two thirds. This situation has been described as a “cliff edge”, referring to the lack of trained successors.\n\nSome European jurisdictions are more flexible in allowing the retention of lawyers who reach retirement age. For instance, Ireland allows the practice of law even after 80 years of age. But these exceptions have not resolved the situation. On the contrary, as the number of lawyers in Europe decreases, their average age is also growing, leaving Europe with an even larger challenge in the future.\n\nAn ageing population is not the only problem that Europe’s legal profession is facing. Younger lawyers who remain in the profession after completing their training, show a high rate of inactivity (one out of four young lawyers in Europe). One of the reasons for this is that in many countries there is a lack of opportunities to practise law.\n\nTherefore, the profession needs to address these problems by improving the work-life balance and offering better opportunities for young lawyers. Otherwise, the profession will continue to experience a demographic crisis.\n\nFor further information see: http://www.blr.europa.eu/blr-vlt/database-data/lawyer-age-average-retirement-europe-european-law-family/3_entry-page/6_entry-page-tab/88_entry-page-slider/
