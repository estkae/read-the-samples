A(nother) Year of Pops: 4-25-13- Epic Meal Time's "The Great Food Race"- PIZZA\n\nThe Topic: 'The Great Food Race'\n\nThe Song: "What I'm Made Of" by Epic Meal Time\n\nYou all knew this was coming, right?\n\n\n\nI started this whole A(nother) Year of Pops concept with a song about chicken wings. That was then, this is now. Now I have expanded my horizons to include this highly, highly enjoyable show called Epic Meal Time. What is it about? Food, obviously. And ridiculousness. And Canadians. More specifically, though, it is about the most Epic of Meals, in that they are very, very awesome. They are cooked, yes, but also very bizarre in their preparation, including highly (yet entertainingly) painful stunts such as "the Buffalo Wing Challenge," in which the chef tries to eat (and/or vomit) an entire pound of wings.\n\n\n\nAnd to complement the decadence, Epic Meal Time has a soundtrack that's perfectly themed to the show. The music is mostly house/dance/dubstep, and each episode has a song at the end that is the perfect finale. Each episode also has the most enjoyable opening sequence I have ever seen. It's four guys sitting around a table, either cooking or eating, and each has a mike in front of them, and they rattle off all the things that they are going to cook or eat that day, using the word "epic" as much as possible. And it's hilarious. Then the song kicks in, and you're off to the races.\n\n\n\nI know that it's a bit difficult to explain what this show is all about without showing it to you, but trust me, it's hilarious. It's almost like watching a housewife's cooking show (so maybe don't watch with your parents) but with a more liberal definition of the word "epic." A very liberal definition. Like, the guys take a whole cow, cut it up, and grill it (all in one day) and then use all of the body parts, from the head to the hooves, in different dishes. I mean, what more could you want from a show?\n\n\n\nI tried to find the episode I have to show you, but the only thing I could find was the show with the crazy amounts of shrimp in it. Now, I would normally not be interested in eating shrimp, but it was worth watching just to hear one of the guys explain why he thinks "shrimp is a very controversial seafood."\n\n\n\nAnd just to show you how versatile this band is, here's a completely different kind of video, with their song "What I'm Made Of." It's a "behind-the-scenes" type thing where they all tell the camera that they are made of meat, which in turn makes them look like meat. How clever! The band even includes an occasional video that they call "Shank It," where they do stuff with their shank. It's fun to watch and to listen to.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, to sum up, I know that I have kind of trashed on most of the music that I have listened to this year, but not on this one. I hope that you check out Epic Meal Time, because it is hilarious, and the songs are pretty catchy, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments
