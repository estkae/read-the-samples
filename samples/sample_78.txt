SEOUL, Oct. 30 (Korea Bizwire) — A shopping mall in southern Seoul opened on Wednesday with facial recognition technology installed in the washrooms for toilet paper dispensers.\n\nShoppers at the VOGUE shopping mall on Gwanghwamun in Seoul can use facial recognition to automatically dispense toilet paper, according to the mall’s management company, which boasts that it’s the first time that facial recognition technology has been applied to a toilet paper dispenser.\n\nThe facial recognition software automatically senses the number of sheets dispensed. It also allows the user to set an alarm to sound after a preset number of sheets has been dispensed.\n\nThe software is set to go on trial until November, when the management company will decide whether to expand its application to other toilet paper dispensers.\n\nFacial recognition technology is already being used in other places in Seoul, such as apartment complexes and an upscale golf course.\n\nBy Joseph Shin (jss539@koreabizwire.com)
