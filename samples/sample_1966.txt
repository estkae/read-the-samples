They don't list the specs and I'm not sure what is compatible. There are multiple options to choose from. I would like it to work with BLHeli software if possible.\n\nAll of the frames are the same but there are 2 options for the flight controller.\n\nhttp://kinekt.com/product-list\n\nYou can go with the Base or Pro.\n\nThe Base comes with the Orange FC, the Pro comes with the Black FC.\n\n\n\nThe difference between the two FC's is that the Base uses a non-inverted SBUS, and the Pro is inverted. You can check which you need by looking at the directions for your RX. If it doesn't say then you need to just do a voltage check. To do this power on the Kinekt, place the throttle stick to low and the trim to full back. Measure the voltage between the 5V and GND pads. It should be somewhere around 5V. If it is then you are good to go with the Orange FC. If it isn't then you are going to need the Black FC.\n\nAs far as compatible flight controllers go you can pretty much use whatever you want. There is a list on the website for specs. I've only used the EMAX and the Flip32's but both work well.
