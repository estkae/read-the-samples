I can tell you exactly what happened. We had gone for some campaign work and we were about to enter a village and my husband was in front and his security was behind him, when suddenly, we saw a group of people coming from the bushes.\n\n\n\n“I was in the car behind him and I saw them. They were shouting. We were in the car and they stopped him and told him to get out and before he got out of the car, they shot him. He died instantly,” Madam Comfort Akyea narrated.\n\n\n\nAccording to her, when the militants saw the security personnel and she come out of the car, they took her to a bushy area and started threatening her to leave the place.\n\n\n\n“They started threatening me and I was like ‘no, no’, because I am a Christian and I know I could not leave my husband there like that. So I insisted that I would not leave. I told them I have nowhere to go,” she recounted.\n\n\n\nAccording to Madam Comfort Akyea, she went to check on her late husband, but he was already dead.\n\n\n\n“So, they told me that I should come out of the car. They took my driver and left the car behind and I was sitting in the back of the car and they came to me and started threatening me and said they were going to kill me if I do not leave the car and that if I do not leave, they will shoot me,” she added.\n\n\n\nShe said they took her out of the car and forced her into the bush and started threatening her to leave and in the process she hurt her right knee.\n\n\n\nAccording to Madam Comfort Akyea, she got a call from one of the officials of the CPP and the police and military were called in to rescue her.\n\n\n\n“They called someone to call me on my phone and told me to go back to my car and told me that they were going to shoot me. They started shooting me and I fell down and hurt my knee. I fell down and I called my husband,” she narrated.\n\n\n\nShe said she had to call the Deputy Regional Minister of the Northern Regional, Eric Mensah, to assist her.\n\n\n\n“They called someone to call me on my phone and told me to go back to my car and told me that they were going to shoot me.

They were a bit late and the people were still there,” she said.\n\n\n\nThe widow of the deceased told DAILY GUIDE that the government failed to take a decisive action against the culprits.\n\n\n\n“We were shocked that it happened that way because we had been following the reports on the news that he had been transferred to the police. But after the transfer, it was worse and he was killed,” she lamented.\n\n\n\nShe said she would be sending in the form of her husband’s death to the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) and she expected the government to do something about it.\n\n\n\nMadam Comfort Akyea noted that if the government was going to protect some citizens, it must protect all citizens, regardless of their political affiliation.\n\n\n\nShe was quick to add that since her husband’s death, some individuals who claimed to be associated with the ruling party had visited her home to threaten her.\n\n\n\nShe said they threatened her to stop making statements to the media, adding that they also warned her that if she did not stop, she would meet the same fate as her late husband.\n\n\n\nThe widow said she would be taking up the matter with the police to protect her.\n\n\n\nThe Executive Director of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR), Kofi Adams, who spoke to DAILY GUIDE on the matter, said Madam Comfort Akyea had sent in the necessary forms to the CHRAJ to seek redress over her husband’s death.\n\n\n\nMr. Adams said the widow had explained to the commission that there was need to probe her husband’s death.\n\n\n\nHe said the CDHR believed that Mr. Akyea was an innocent victim of the militancy activities in the Northern Region and urged the government to protect its citizens.\n\n\n\nMr. Adams said the CPP should be investigated for its involvement in the death of Mr. Akyea.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief Executive Officer of Citi FM, Edmund Obeng Amponsah, who spoke to DAILY GUIDE in an interview, said he was happy to know that Mrs. Akyea had indicated that she was not interested in politics anymore.\n\n\n\nMr. Amponsah said he was shocked to know that a widow of a prominent politician was intimidated by some people who claimed to be associated with the ruling NDC, adding that Mrs. Akyea was well aware that her husband was killed.\n\n\n\n“It is a pity for a person who is a wife of a politician to be threatened. The Constitution of Ghana says every Ghanaian is equal. We have a Constitution and we must abide by it. It is sad that people will be threatened for telling the truth,” he said.\n\n\n\nA businessman, Bernard Sampson, in an interview with DAILY GUIDE, described Mr. Akyea’s death as unfortunate.\n\n\n\nHe said the people of the Northern Region would always remember him for his contributions to the region.\n\n\n\nMr. Sampson said the late Mr. Akyea was a committed party official, who was passionate about his work and dedicated to serving his people.\n\n\n\nMr. Sampson said Mr. Akyea would be remembered for his wisdom and knowledge of issues in the region.
