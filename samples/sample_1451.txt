I like getting used books at the bookstore, library sales, Goodwill, or used book websites such as Better World Books.\n\nBetter World Books gives the schools and libraries who choose them 5% of the profits for their use.\n\nHere is a list of my recent purchases on my wishlist on Better World Books, and I will update this list if I buy more.\n\nI have been receiving books on my wishlist lately! I am on a wait list for two of them now, and will update once I receive them. I should be able to post my finished list in a couple of months.\n\nAdvertisements
