Today we review one of my favorite paleo treat – the Paleovalley’s Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough.\n\nAs you may know, I’m a huge fan of Paleovalley’s. For my experience with Paleovalley, go check out this post!\n\nLike many Paleo eaters, I really missed having cookies on the go – paleo or not.\n\nWhen I heard that Paleovalley made Paleo Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, I was instantly excited. But I wanted to know if it was really worth the hype and the price.\n\nThe reason I like paleo-friendly treats so much is because I can have them on the go or right out of the fridge.\n\nAnd because I’m a busy mom who needs snacks.\n\nWhen I opened the jar and tried the Paleovalley’s Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough for the first time, I was sooo surprised.\n\nUsually, anything coconut-based has a weird taste to me, so I was prepared for this.\n\nBut the cookie dough was really tasty.\n\nI was even more surprised when I found out that there were no refined sugar, preservatives, and not even refined flour.\n\nIt’s made with a blend of real vanilla, butter, and coconut oil and sweetened with dates.\n\nI’m definitely ordering a box or two of the Paleo Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough soon.\n\nAnd it’s available in four flavors – Paleo Chocolate Chip, Cinnamon Raisin, Apple Cinnamon, and Coconut.\n\nI have yet to try the other three.\n\nAt about $6/jar, it’s a little bit more expensive than buying it at Whole Foods or other retailers. But when I’m in a pinch and need something to go, the price is well worth it!\n\nDid you try the Paleovalley’s Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough yet?\n\nDo you think you’ll try it?\n\nAlso Read: Paleo Sandwich Breads
