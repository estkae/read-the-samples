"Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders has promised to end our current immigration policies and implement a new policy, which will favor immigrants from countries that have a history of struggling with socialism.\n\nDuring his CNN town hall, Sanders was asked by an illegal immigrant named Marcela if he planned to help her and her fellow undocumented brethren.\n\n“Absolutely, we will,” Sanders replied.\n\n“The idea that you have so many wonderful people who want to contribute to the fabric of our society,” he said, “is something I very, very strongly believe in.”\n\n“That means,” he continued, “we need comprehensive immigration reform.”\n\nSanders’ new immigration reform will make it much easier for those who have socialist tendencies to move to America.\n\n“What it does is bring 11 million undocumented people out of the shadows. It would provide them with legal protection and allow them to work with full rights in this country. And it would provide a path toward citizenship,” he explained.\n\n“I voted against this draconian legislation in 2006. I voted against it again in 2013. And I will do everything in my power to overturn it.”\n\n“We need a path toward citizenship for people who are undocumented,” he concluded.\n\nIronically, Sanders was able to support this legislation because his socialistic tendencies weren’t under the scrutiny of a large voting base. Had he been elected in this era, his political allies would have been able to reveal the fact that he is a hypocrite, as he supported immigration legislation which could potentially cost Americans their jobs.\n\nThere’s no denying that immigrants have helped to build our country and that immigration is vital to our national security and our economic health. But there’s a time and a place for everything, and a time to admit when you were wrong, especially when that error may have hurt Americans.\n\nSource: Daily Caller
