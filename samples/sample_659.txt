"This just in: Donald Trump is the subject of a feature length documentary being produced by no less than – wait for it – HBO. But before you go and boycott the premium cable network for giving a platform to someone who stands for everything it stands against, you may want to know the project in question is in fact a parody, albeit a very, very well-made one.\n\nCreated by filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi and titled “Meet the Donors: Does Money Talk,” the faux-documentary is meant to satirize the network’s documentary “Meet the Donors: Does Money Talk,” which is currently airing. The spoof is part of a new season of programming that includes “The Breastfeeding Scene,” which stars Anna Faris as a lactating nanny who hires a lawyer after her breasts decide to strike on her behalf; “Sex Scene,” about a woman played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus who has sex with a pizza delivery man and then orders another pizza; and “Sugar Daddy: The Eddy Lewis Story,” about a disabled teenager whose “Sugar Daddy” is played by a real life sugar daddy played by Chaz Bono.\n\nAccording to HBO’s official press release, “The film is built around the voices of the documentary’s real-life subjects who comprise a who’s who of real-life political heavyweights – from George Soros to Newt Gingrich, Ken Griffin to David Koch, and Sheldon Adelson to Sheldon Adelson.”
