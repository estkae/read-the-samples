Étude Op. 10, No. 4 (Chopin)\n\nÉtude Op. 10, No. 4, in E major, is a technical study composed by Frédéric Chopin in 1830. It was first published as the fourth piece of his "Études Op. 10" in 1833. The piece is primarily used to develop and perfect the use of the third and fifth fingers. The piece is relatively easy, but to some it may present a challenge in the middle of the right hand section. The middle of the right hand section, for some, can be difficult because the shift in key can throw the pianist off.\n\nThis étude is in the key of E major, the relative minor of Chopin's native key of E minor. It follows the ABA form, with the central section being marked "Allegretto". The piece is mostly played with the third and fifth fingers.\n\nThe first page of this étude is an example of the common "bariolage" technique, in which two or more adjacent notes are alternated quickly with a melody note. The étude is also one of the many that, along with Op. 10, No. 5, uses the trill extensively.\n\n"Étude Op. 10, No. 4" is the most difficult piece in Chopin's étude Op. 10, and it can be considered the most difficult of his études altogether. This difficulty is due in part to the "bariolage" finger technique required, and also because the piece starts and ends in the wrong hand. The difficulty of the piece is also due to the usage of the two black keys that are not used in the first three études, which make it harder to transition into and out of the black keys. The black keys are not used in the first three études because they would confuse the students, but now, because the students have become more proficient, they are ready to use them. This is the reason why Chopin starts and ends the étude in the right hand, because it is the less accustomed to using the black keys. Some pianists, such as Nelson Goerner"
