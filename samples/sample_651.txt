"Now and then a student will say to me, “I’m just not a numbers person.” And I think, “What does that mean?” How can someone not be a numbers person?\n\nOne could say that an artist is not a numbers person, because the whole idea of putting together all the math for the math-phobic is too much to face. The mere thought of a formula involving the product of 2 variables is enough to scare some artists off.\n\nAnother person who may not be a numbers person is the person who prefers to deal with a different language than mathematical. I’m not sure if I’m one of these people, but if I were, I’d be perfectly comfortable with a quantitative paradigm of programming. A programming paradigm is a way of thinking about a problem. Some paradigms are so different from the norm that the programmer is not using their usual way of thinking.\n\nThe paradigm I’m trying to achieve with my students is one that values beauty over time-saving, and that celebrates failure as the first step in learning something new. This paradigm includes some math, but it also has an art component, and one that is not entirely unique. I’m following in the footsteps of others who, as educators, have been far ahead of the learning curve on this one. And there is something else that makes this paradigm different, and that is that the paradigm is about the learner. My job is not to provide solutions to all of my students’ problems, but to be there to help them develop the solutions for themselves.\n\nBut before this can happen, the learner needs to get past his or her self-doubt, and start to imagine that, just maybe, it’s possible to make a difference in this world. The way to do that is by experimenting, failing, making mistakes, and moving on.
