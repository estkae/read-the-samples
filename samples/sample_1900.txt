Metallica's Kirk Hammett is a monster riff-monger with a guitar that can spit fire. But he didn't always have it all together.\n\nAs he recalls in this hilarious scene from a documentary about Lemmy that he narrates, in which the late Motorhead frontman is playing guitar while wearing only his underwear.\n\nHammett then delivers an astonishingly tone-deaf version of a Deep Purple song, which the other guys in Metallica mock him for. It's all in good fun, though. Lemmy says the guy is a great guitarist.\n\nKirk Hammett is good enough that he's still with Metallica today.
