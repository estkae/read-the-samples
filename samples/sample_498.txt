"Would You Accept A Ridiculously Generous Gift?\n\nThe book, Cults Inside Out, claims to reveal everything you ever wanted to know about cults, from recruiting and controlling techniques to the manipulation of the children of cult members. The book is written by Jeremy Spencer, who claims that his grandfather was a cult leader and that his father was in a cult. It is hoped that by publishing this book that Jeremy Spencer can stop this cycle and prevent any other children from being hurt in this way.\n\nA spokesperson for Jeremy Spencer has confirmed that he is desperately in need of some cash to fund the marketing and promotion of the book. The cost is simply too great to risk doing it alone. He hopes that if he can raise enough money to pay for advertising, then he will be able to share his story and help people.\n\nIf Jeremy Spencer can raise enough money for the book, then he will gift it to the person who donates the most money. The donation can be made via the crowdfunding site Kickstarter.com.\n\nDonating to this crowdfunding campaign is likely to have more benefits than simply receiving a copy of the book. You can be part of the book and even get a speaking part in it. This is a great opportunity to help someone with a great story."\n\nKickstarter is a crowdfunding website that allows you to donate money to people who are trying to raise money for something. In return for your donations, you can receive gifts from the person you are donating to.\n\nWould You Accept A Ridiculously Generous Gift?\n\nA friend of mine contacted me a few months ago to ask if I would consider reviewing a book for them. The book was called Cults Inside Out and the author is called Jeremy Spencer. He has offered to donate the book to the highest bidder.\n\nCults Inside Out is the first of a trilogy and Jeremy Spencer is trying to raise money to self-publish the second book. As part of his plan, Jeremy is offering to donate the book to the highest bidder. The highest bidder is whoever donates the most money to Jeremy's GoFundMe account.\n\nWould you accept a ridiculously generous gift? I decided that I would.\n\nJeremy Spencer is an interesting character. I had never heard of him before and I was sceptical about some of the things that he had to say. Jeremy is a bit of a controversial character and he is no stranger to the press. He is very controversial and he has a history of being sued for libel, but you can find out more about that on his GoFundMe page.\n\nThe book is about cults and how they use manipulation techniques to recruit people into their organisations. The book also talks about the psychology of the cult members and how they get manipulated. There is some fascinating stuff in there and it is an easy read.\n\nThe book starts with the stories of two children who were born into cults. One child was the son of a cult leader and the other child was the daughter of another cult leader. Both children were exposed to extreme forms of cult abuse and you can really feel the pain that they went through.\n\nI didn't really enjoy reading the stories of the two children because it was so sad. You could really feel their pain. I am glad that Jeremy was able to escape the cult, but I don't think that it is an easy thing to do. There are always going to be repercussions, no matter how many years later.\n\nAfter the stories of the two children, Jeremy goes on to talk about the psychology of the cult members. I didn't realise that there were so many different reasons why people join cults. There are a number of factors that can influence the decision to join a cult.\n\nThere are a number of strategies that cults use to recruit new members and Jeremy goes on to discuss the techniques that they use. He talks about how they use manipulation and persuasion techniques to encourage people to join them. Jeremy is not the first person to talk about these strategies, but he does explain them in a very clear way.\n\nJeremy also talks about the different kinds of cults and what they are like. There are religious cults and political cults and there are even business cults. There are all kinds of cults and it is fascinating to read about how they are structured and what they are all about.\n\nJeremy Spencer has also included information about his family and his time in the cult. I have never been in a cult, so I don't know what it is like, but I was impressed with how well Jeremy handled the subject. He didn't talk about the cult in a negative way and he didn't try to make it sound worse than it was.\n\nThere is a lot of information about cults in this book and Jeremy doesn't try to overstate any of the facts. He doesn't try to talk in hyperbole and he gives very factual descriptions of what it is like to be in a cult.\n\nIf you are a fan of cults, then this book is going to be right up your street. If you are just interested in psychology, then this book is also going to be right up your street. There are a lot of interesting theories and a lot of fascinating facts.\n\nThere are a number of interesting stories and you can really feel the emotion in this book. I am glad that I have read it, but I don't think that I will read the rest of the trilogy.\n\nWhat you will get if you make the highest bid\n\nIf you make the highest bid on Jeremy's GoFundMe page, then he will send you a copy of Cults Inside Out. The money that you donate will be used to help with the marketing and promotion of the book.\n\nI have seen people donate large amounts of money to crowdfunding projects, so it is definitely possible. Jeremy is even offering to sign your copy of the book, if you make the highest bid.\n\nThe book is available in paperback and as an e-book. You will also be able to get it in various different languages. It is likely to be available in a number of different countries.\n\nYou can get a signed copy of the book for just $30 and Jeremy has been very generous with his offers. There are some very generous rewards if you can make the highest bid. Jeremy is determined to get this book out and he will give you the opportunity to help him.\n\nIf you are interested in making the highest bid, then click here.
