What happened\n\nShares of Applied Optoelectronics Inc (NASDAQ:AAOI) were getting hammered on Thursday after the networking specialist reported a quarterly loss and revenue that missed estimates. The news sent the stock down 15% at the time of this writing, putting it on pace to be the stock's worst day since late 2016.\n\nSo what\n\nInvestors were expecting Applied Optoelectronics to lose money in the fourth quarter, as it has lost money in each of the past two quarters. But the loss this time around was bigger than expected, with Applied Optoelectronics reporting a non-GAAP net loss of $0.40 per share on a 14% decline in revenue to $93.9 million. Analysts, on average, were only looking for a loss of $0.33 per share on $92.1 million in revenue.\n\nNow what\n\nCEO Paul E. Jacobs called the results a "solid performance" and said the company's overall sales were "driven by market growth" and its plan to "increase long-term shareholder value." Applied Optoelectronics also noted that its total customer backlog rose 20% year over year to $347 million, which is more than analysts were looking for.\n\nWith the company's stock now trading down 45% over the past year, however, it will need to show much more than "solid performance" to prove that its turnaround is working. To start with, it needs to stop the losses and start producing profits again. If it can do that, then the rise in the backlog will be a positive sign, and investors may start to take a fresh look at the company again.
