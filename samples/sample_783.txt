Every social encounter can be a learning experience. These pages are for the casual observer who has an interest in the antics and unique behaviors that birds exhibit during social interactions. The field guide pages on this site are targeted to those interested in identifying species and learning about behaviors to find and identify birds.\n\nIt is important to realize that no two species exhibit the same behaviors. In this area we have started to examine what are called signatures and a few good examples of this would be:\n\n1) Acrobatic (Cedar Waxwing, Blue Jay)\n\n2) Furtive and Snatching (Bewickâ€™s Wren, House Wren, Northern Mockingbird)\n\n3) Harsh (Barn Swallow, Great Horned Owl)\n\n4) Loud Calls (American Robin, Ruffed Grouse)\n\n5) Music (Great Crested Flycatcher, Northern Mockingbird)\n\n6) Mimic (Northern Cardinal, Yellow Warbler)\n\n7) Nocturnal (White-tailed Kite)\n\n8) Simple and Direct (American Crow, Barn Swallow)\n\n9) Speedy (Song Sparrow)\n\n10) Surprising (Northern Mockingbird)\n\n11) Trilling (Yellow-bellied Sapsucker)\n\n12) Unruffled (Blue Jay)\n\n13) Watchful (Raven, Killdeer)\n\nThere is no better way to observe social interactions in nature than by attending a bird-banding event. If you are unfamiliar with the practices of bird banding in North America you can learn more about it here.
