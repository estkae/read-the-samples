"STOCKHOLM â€” In a Scandinavian twist to the final race of the series, American David Hargitt was awarded the North American Pro Kart Challenge championship over Canadian Fredrik Ekblom on Saturday night at Karlskoga Arena in Sweden.\n\nHargitt had an on-track confrontation with Ekblom earlier this season at Spa-Francorchamps, Belgium, during which Hargitt, now 28, ran into Ekblom, a now 18-year-old Canadian, with his kart, sending both into the barriers.\n\nBoth drivers were knocked out of the race.\n\nBut Hargitt ended the six-race season as the champion, his third overall series title and first since 2004. Hargitt and Ekblom finished with 107 and 96 points, respectively.\n\nHargitt finished first and second in the last two races to hold onto his lead. Ekblom won the first race of the year and finished third in the final race.\n\nDavid Hargitt, in a Pirelli factory-backed kart, and Ekblom, a Tony Kart factory driver, finished second and third behind series champion Thomas Preining.
