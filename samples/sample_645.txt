I loved it! It is more work than it looks, but it's soooo worth it!! This is one of my favorite fall crafts, and I do it year after year. (I've also used orange and pink!)\n\nThis is the perfect project for the kids in the house to help with! It's a great craft that they will think you spent a lot more time on than you actually did! You can make it as detailed or simple as you'd like.\n\nWhat You'll Need:\n\nJute Cord (you'll need enough to cover the entire base of the tree, and enough to weave through the sticks)\n\nCorn Starch (you'll need about 1/2 cup to cover your tree)\n\nAcrylic Paint (your choice of colors)\n\nPaint Brushes\n\nYarn\n\nNeedle\n\nHot Glue Gun\n\nWooden Twigs\n\nStart by cutting your jute cord into four-foot lengths. Once you have enough, you can tie them into bundles with a knot. (Tip: Make sure you cut it longer than you think you will need, because the size of the tree will shrink quite a bit once you put the cornstarch on it.)\n\nNext, you will need to cover the jute cord with cornstarch. Put the cornstarch in a bowl, and then dip the end of the jute cord into it. Then, use your paint brush to push the cornstarch down onto the jute cord. You may have to do this more than once, and you'll probably have to wait a few minutes for the cornstarch to dry in between coats.\n\nWhen your jute cord is covered in cornstarch, put it on a baking sheet and bake it in the oven for about 30 minutes at 150 degrees. This will dry the cornstarch and make it so you don't have to worry about water getting on your tree.\n\nOnce it is dry, you can start making your tree! Start by finding a tall jar or drinking glass. If you don't have one handy, a plastic soda bottle will do. When you have your tree trunk, tie a knot at the top and then start weaving the jute cord around it. Once it's the way you like it, tie another knot at the top to secure it in place.\n\nRepeat this process with your remaining sticks until you have as many trees as you'd like. When you're finished, attach your trees to the base of your tree using hot glue and yarn.\n\nOnce you have your tree complete, you can start decorating it. I added some fall leaves, and you could also use glitter, ornaments, etc.\n\nI'm seriously thinking about hanging my fall trees from the chandelier this year!
