Frontier Wars is an attempt to trace the development of political ideas and their relationships with warfare in the Anglo-American world from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century. Emphasis is placed on the relationship between military organization, including the technology of war, and military methods on the one hand and political ideas, economic developments, and technological change on the other. It also argues that it is impossible to understand the military history of the Anglo-American world during this period without a knowledge of what was happening in the other three quarters of the world, a point of view which will be developed in the second volume.\n\nNoel Malcolm uses examples from the Dutch Revolt, the English Civil Wars, and the American Civil War, as well as those from Scotland, France, India, and the West Indies.
