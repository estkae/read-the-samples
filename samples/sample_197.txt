Magic: the Gathering has launched the Dominaria campaign. Dominaria is a plane steeped in rich lore and ancient magics. The world is home to several important factions, including Benalia, home to the Knights of Benalia, and the nation of Corondor. Corondor is ruled by Baron Sengir and his brother, Baron Sardu.\n\nDominaria is also home to some of Magic’s most iconic characters. The Weatherlight is crewed by a legendary host of characters, including Captain Sisay, Karn, and Teferi. But the Weatherlight’s roster is far from limited to famous crew members.\n\nThis is the history of the Weatherlight’s crew members who weren’t famous enough to get their own card.\n\n(Special thanks to Jason Carl’s Comprehensive Rules FAQ and to YSDC’s flavor text wiki for their incredible flavor text sources.)\n\nVenser, Shaper Savant\n\nVenser is an artificer who discovered his latent Planeswalker abilities while recovering from an injury on the plane of Shandalar.
