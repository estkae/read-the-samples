The Journey from Delhi to Jaisalmer\n\nThe Journey from Delhi to Jaisalmer\n\nTwo days back, after visiting my maternal aunt at Ghaziabad, I had boarded the train to Jaisalmer from Delhi's Nizamuddin Railway station. I was supposed to reach Jaisalmer by noon but the journey was delayed due to a technical problem in the train.\n\nThere was a confusion and it seemed as if all trains going to Jaisalmer had to cross the Jaisalmer railway station. The train departed from Nizamuddin station at 2.45 pm and we reached Jaisalmer at 6.30 am. We all know that our Indian Railways are in pathetic conditions but our train journey from Delhi to Jaisalmer was the most comfortable train journey I had till date. The train had an AC chair car, a sleeper class and the top most travel class. There was a lot of empty space in the lower class and I was happy to find a berth in the lower class.\n\nBut soon my happiness turned into anxiety. I was sitting in the middle of a group of army officers who were travelling to Jaisalmer. These men were burly and they were talking to each other in a language which I did not understand. One of the men kept staring at me and he soon came to me and asked for a seat. I had no problem in giving him the seat as I had two seats next to me. I offered him a chair and I stood near the door. After half an hour the man spoke to me in Hindi and I asked him what he was doing in Jaisalmer. He told me that he was going to meet his colleague and that he was a Lieutenant in the Indian Army.\n\nHe asked me to sit beside him and I obliged. Soon we were talking about everything under the sky. I asked him how many times he had visited Jaisalmer and he told me that he was going to Jaisalmer for the first time. I was surprised to hear this and I asked him about the weather in Jaisalmer. The Lieutenant told me that Jaisalmer was always cold and the summers were unbearable. I wondered why a man who was going to Jaisalmer for the first time was so informed about the weather. The Lieutenant must have guessed what I was thinking because he told me that he had seen the place in the photographs and that he was going to the place because of his profession.\n\nI smiled and told him that I was in the same profession and I was going to Jaisalmer to shoot a story for my media house.\n\n"Really?" asked the Lieutenant, "What is the name of the media house?"\n\n"Zoom."\n\n"Zoom is a famous media house."\n\n"It is indeed."\n\n"I saw your photographs in Zoom's website and I was awestruck. You must be a very good photographer."\n\n"I am learning photography."\n\n"May I see your cameras?"\n\nI took out the two cameras which I had with me. The Lieutenant looked at my cameras and he seemed to be a photography expert. I saw him switch on my camera and he started fiddling with the buttons. He pressed the zoom button and zoomed into the lens of my camera. The Lieutenant said, "It is a good camera and it is expensive. I hope you do not get it stolen. Do you want me to keep it for you?"\n\nI thanked him for the offer and I asked him about the camera I had in my hand.\n\n"This is a good camera," said the Lieutenant, "I like it a lot."\n\nHe took my camera in his hand and he looked at me and said, "Will you give me this camera?"\n\nI looked at him and I asked him, "Why do you want my camera?"\n\n"Because you will be going to the Army area and you may not be able to take photographs."\n\n"But I can take photographs in the Army area too. Besides, you can help me to click the photographs. You are an Army man."\n\nThe Lieutenant smiled and said, "I am just an ordinary Lieutenant and you must be aware that the area which you are going to is highly sensitive. There are armed guards all around. You will be in great trouble if you try to take photographs in that area. I will help you to click the photographs and besides, I am an Army man. I can help you."\n\nI thought for a while and I agreed to give him my camera.\n\nThe train soon reached Jaisalmer and it was 6.30 am. I was the first one to get down the train. I took out my bags and when I turned back I saw that the Lieutenant had already come out of the train.\n\n"Where is your camera?" asked the Lieutenant.\n\nI told him that I had kept my camera in the train.\n\n"You are mad. Who will help you in clicking photographs? Do you want me to take the camera from the train?"\n\nI shook my head. The Lieutenant did not waste any time and he asked me to wait for him near the train. The Lieutenant went to the train and in less than ten minutes he came back with my camera. He handed over the camera to me and asked me to pay Rs. 500 for my camera.\n\n"Why do you want to pay me for my camera?"\n\n"Because it is not your camera. You had left the camera in the train and I am returning it to you."\n\nI looked at him and I told him that I did not have 500 rupees with me. I told him that I had only 250 rupees in my bag.\n\n"Will that be enough?"\n\nThe Lieutenant smiled and he said, "That will be fine. Just give me the money and you can keep the camera."\n\nI took out the money from my bag and gave it to him. The Lieutenant took the money and he put the money in his trouser pocket and he told me to keep the camera in my bag.\n\n"Where are you staying?"\n\n"I am not sure where I am going to stay."\n\n"Don't worry, I will help you."\n\nI thanked him and the Lieutenant told me that he had booked a room in Hotel Haveli.\n\n"Why have you booked a room in the Hotel Haveli? I don't like the hotel. You can stay with me."\n\n"I don't want to trouble you."\n\n""
