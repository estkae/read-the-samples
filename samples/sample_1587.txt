"Naval Officer's Belt\n\nNaval Officer's Belt\n\nDiscontinued\n\nItem No. 769\n\nThe Naval Officer's Belt was used in a long line of dress from the Civil War through World War II. It is styled from the waist belt used with the garrison and gala double-breasted frock coat during the Civil War, with a pair of buckles on the ends. From this belt evolved the double buckle belt that is still in use today. This belt is made from quality leather and features silver-tone double-pronged conchos on the ends. Also included is a silver-toned military buckle. This is a very useful belt that can be worn with several styles of Civil War uniforms and officer's uniforms of later eras.
