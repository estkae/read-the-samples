Amma’s Oats dosa recipe is great for a light breakfast or evening snack for kids. Packed with the goodness of oats and nutritious chana dal, this dosas are also high in protein.\n\nUsually made with black dal (split black gram) or Bengal gram dal, this is a popular dish of North Karnataka, especially the malnad region. Since I have no clue of the ingredients, my guess is that it may be an offshoot of the well-known erachi sattu (dal cakes) of Karnataka. Whatever it may be, it’s a tasty dish that can be easily prepared at home. Amma’s Oats dosa recipe is quite different from the regular dosas or other dosa variations, both in the taste and texture. This is very soft and spongy and you would almost eat it like a crepe. Oats give this a slightly chewy texture, while the chana dal imparts a mild nutty flavour.\n\nI also tried some variations. I soaked some rice overnight and used the soaked water to grind it. The resulting dosa did not come out so great. It was a little grainy and did not have the spongy texture. The recipe is a little elaborate, but worth the effort. If you have kids, I bet they will love it. Serve with coconut chutney, or any other chutney of your choice.\n\nFor making dosas, this batter requires the grinded lentils to be slightly coarse. This will allow the batter to flow through the griddle or pan in thin films.\n\nCheck out the Oats Dosa recipe.
