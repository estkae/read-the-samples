The Bengals fell just short of a win in Kansas City Sunday, falling to the Chiefs 31-13. The loss drops the Bengals to 7-9, a number that still includes a loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars in London.\n\nOne of the biggest stories to come out of this loss is the fact that star running back Jeremy Hill was benched in favor of Rex Burkhead. Hill didn't have a good game, and the Chiefs were able to put him in his place. Burkhead was also pretty good, and scored the only Bengals touchdown on the day.\n\nBoth running backs ran for over 100 yards, but the key difference was Hill fumbled twice, including once inside the Chiefs' 20. Hill had carried the ball 39 times before the benching, while Burkhead had just nine.\n\nIt was announced Monday that Hill is still the Bengals' starting running back going forward.\n\n#Bengals Jeremy Hill named starting running back in 2018, Mixon to see more action. https://t.co/jZ9624gBwO pic.twitter.com/jOKGewN4zq â€” Kevin Clark (@bykevinclark) January 1, 2018\n\nThis is an interesting decision, considering the way the Bengals used the two running backs in Kansas City. Hill has been a solid running back throughout his career, but has shown lapses in concentration, as well as fumbling issues. He's not been consistent, and that has made the Bengals hesitant to hand him the starting job.\n\nThe Bengals will likely be looking to get more out of their running backs next season. We saw how talented Joe Mixon is this year, and he's the one who should have the starting job next season.\n\nHill will still be involved in the offense, but this change is a sign that he won't be a starter for the Bengals next season.
