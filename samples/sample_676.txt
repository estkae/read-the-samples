Who's to blame?\n\nToday at a San Diego Comic-Con panel, Marvel made some pretty big announcements about its Inhumans franchise, including a major change for the show.\n\nThe ABC series will no longer be a TV show, but a limited series of movies that will hit theaters first, and then air on TV.\n\nMarvel Studios president Kevin Feige was joined on stage by Jeph Loeb, head of Marvel Television. Feige took the blame for this change, admitting that the show had changed since its inception.\n\nMarvel TV and Film Are Now One "Unified Narrative" in the MCU 10+ IMAGES Fullscreen Image Artboard 3 Copy Artboard 3 ESC 01 OF 13 Marvel's Inhumans star Anson Mount in Marvel's Inhumans: "For years, comic book fans wanted Marvel to bring the Inhumans to the screen, but it wasn't until I joined the Marvel family that I realized the caliber of their anticipation." 01 OF 13 Marvel's Inhumans star Anson Mount in Marvel's Inhumans: "For years, comic book fans wanted Marvel to bring the Inhumans to the screen, but it wasn't until I joined the Marvel family that I realized the caliber of their anticipation."

That's when they decided to rework it into a movie, which will have its own narrative, but will also be tied to the bigger Marvel Cinematic Universe. Loeb and Feige stressed that the show is a completely different property from the movies, but that they do want to see it connect.\n\nAs a result of this change, the pilot of the show, which was already shot, will not be used. So, what was shot?\n\nMarvel's Inhumans: All Character Images 8 IMAGES Fullscreen Image Artboard 3 Copy Artboard 3 ESC 01 OF 08 Black Bolt (Anson Mount) in Marvel's Inhumans 01 OF 08 Black Bolt (Anson Mount) in Marvel's Inhumans Marvel's Inhumans: All Character Images ABC Download Image Captions ESC\n\nThe new version of the show will debut in theaters, but after that, it will move to ABC. It will run for eight episodes, which will then air in a two-hour TV event. The eight-episode run will be followed by the first two episodes of The Inhumans television show, which will then air weekly on ABC. It's unclear if the subsequent six episodes will debut exclusively on the TV show, or in theaters before TV.\n\nAll eight episodes will be made available on the same day for viewers who want to watch on TV. The show will debut on Imax for two weeks.\n\nSo what does this mean for the characters who are set to appear on the show? Black Bolt and Medusa will definitely appear, but they won't be played by Anson Mount and Serinda Swan. Marvel did not announce who will take over the roles of the two leaders of the Inhuman Royal Family.\n\nOn the other hand, Maximus the Mad will be portrayed by Iwan Rheon (Game of Thrones), who's replacing Ken Leung. He was shown on the big screen at the panel.\n\nShowrunner Scott Buck, who's also worked on Iron Fist, is sticking around for the reworked version of the show.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nThe panel also announced several new cast members for the Inhumans movie, including:\n\nEllen Woglom will play an unidentified character.\n\nwill play an unidentified character.
