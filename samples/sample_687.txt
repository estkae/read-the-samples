An engine control unit is a specialised computer that tells the fuel injectors when to spray, what sort of fuel to spray, and how long to spray it for. It also controls various other factors that affect the engine's performance and emissions.\n\nOriginally, engines were controlled by a mechanical device known as a carburettor. This device was connected directly to the throttle cable, which meant that any time the throttle was moved, the carburettor was told to add more fuel. This is an incredibly inefficient way of controlling engine performance, as it is affected by air temperature and pressure as well as throttle position.\n\nTo overcome this, an engine control unit is used to control the air/fuel mixture. In order to do this, the ECU has to measure the engine's performance. It does this by reading various sensors in the engine bay. These sensors tell the ECU how the engine is performing, allowing the ECU to increase or decrease the amount of fuel being sprayed into the engine.
