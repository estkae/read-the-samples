A man died Sunday in China’s western Xinjiang region after setting himself on fire outside a police station, a regional government spokesman said.\n\nThe man set himself ablaze after fighting with local police over a traffic fine, Nur Bekri, head of the regional government, told a press conference.\n\nPolice in the northwestern region were carrying out “stability maintenance work” at the time of the incident, he said.\n\n“He self-immolated after a quarrel over a traffic violation and the police station,” Bekri said, adding that the police handled the case correctly.\n\n“The government urges people to resolve their disputes through legal means,” he said.\n\nIn recent months, dozens of people have set themselves on fire in Xinjiang to protest what they say are human rights abuses, while scores more have resorted to violence or armed assaults against government officials or police stations.\n\nWhile official figures show that most of those who have set themselves on fire are Uyghur, a Turkic-speaking, largely Muslim ethnic group, a majority of those who carried out attacks were Han Chinese, according to reports.\n\nAn estimated 200 people died as a result of the self-immolations or violence last year.\n\n(AFP)\n\n网友评论：\n\n网易辽宁省阜新市手机网友：\n\nThis is nothing. In the most difficult time of the Cultural Revolution, more than a thousand people self-immolated themselves to death, over five million were violently killed, and an entire country was sacrificed for one man. The self-immolators are committing suicide for what? All of this is being sacrificed for a man.\n\n网易河北省廊坊市手机网友：\n\nSending military troops into Urumqi, letting people starve, shoot, slaughter, etc., the government has long since abandoned any kind of “maintenance of stability.” But can they face the fact that a few hundred Uyghurs have gone to extremes? This is the embarrassment of the government, a proof that the lives of the Uyghur are worth even less than the government thinks. I’m just hoping that the Uyghur people will gain their own freedom one day.\n\n网易广东省佛山市手机网友：\n\nTerrorism and arson.\n\nOnly a thief is afraid of fire.\n\nThe history of the burning of books in the East is the same as that of the burning of witches in the West.\n\nThe responsibility of the Uyghurs is in the hands of the government and the people of China.\n\nIf the people of China can be unified, if the government can be clear, it will not be as it is now, nor will it have the effects of spreading instability throughout the world.\n\n网易美国手机网友：\n\nThe most important thing in the Uyghurs’ lives is the love for their children and themselves, as the life of one’s family is the foundation of all things. This is how the Uyghurs are, and this is the reason why they fight back, and this is why they do what they do.\n\nFor example, the government forcibly inserts women into the Uyghur’s households and forces them to wear head scarves, it forcibly strips the children from their families and rears them in “orphanages,” forcibly rips young girls from their parents’ arms to be sent to Tibet, forcibly controls the number of children Uyghurs are allowed to have, forcibly forces Uyghurs to go to Han villages, forcibly encourages them to go to work in the cities, forcibly puts Han businesses into Uyghur homes, forcibly buys out their livestock and agricultural fields to build industrial parks, forcibly forces Uyghur young people to go to school to study and the rest are to go to do factory work, forcibly builds supermarkets, shops, hotels, etc., which gives them no chance to get employment, forcibly makes it so that Uyghur young people can’t find a spouse to get married and have children, forcibly demolishes their houses and forces them to move to another area, forcibly blocks them from having religious activities, etc., etc., the Uyghurs are continuously being forced to endure.\n\nIf you look at the Uyghur protests from a perspective of someone observing them, you can understand how it all began and why it has continued to this day.\n\nThe government has no choice but to take all this, because the Uyghurs are a minority group with nothing to back them up and their lot is really not the greatest.\n\nOn the other hand, if the government wants to go easy on the Uyghurs, this might also lead to the Uyghurs feeling discontent with the government, so it has to be a careful balancing act.\n\nYou know, because of this constant bickering, the government can no longer help the Uyghurs, because it’s already using all its energy to help the Han, which is what it cares about most.\n\n网易湖北省武汉市手机网友：\n\nIf the man really did self-immolate because of the fines, isn’t that a little too extreme? If he had used this method before, it could be understood. But he’s done this only now, this means that he’s only using this method for his own ends. What does this mean? How can people kill themselves and turn themselves into such an extreme protest against injustice? Who are the ones to blame?\n\n网易北京市手机网友：\n\nI am just trying to understand, he set himself on fire to fight over a traffic violation?\n\n网易美国手机网友：\n\nWhen the time comes, there will only be Uyghur resistance and nothing else.\n\n网易湖南省手机网友：\n\nJust look at this, everyone. The Uyghurs have their own methods of protest and methods of expressing their wishes and opinions, which have nothing to do with us.\n\nSo can we stop always picking on them and accusing them of terrorist actions? What they are doing is simply that they are using extreme methods to express their unhappiness and discontent, but I hope that they will consider the extreme actions of their people and act in accordance with the situation in China.\n\nI would like to ask everyone, what do you think?\n\nI believe the true thinking of the masses should be understood.\n\n网易陕西省手机网友：\n\nWhat a shame, they have this kind of personality and they’re so different from us. But since they are living under our government, and their lives are being constantly destroyed, I understand the psychology of people like this.
