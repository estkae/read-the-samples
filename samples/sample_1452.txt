by\n\nRockwell Automation is a smart buy\n\nBack in August I recommended that I thought Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) was a pretty good buy. At the time the stock was trading at $133.73, and has now declined to around $114. Now that I’ve thought more about this stock, and done more research, I think I was too conservative. I think ROK is a very good buy right now. Here’s why.\n\n1. One company selling two product families for double digit revenue growth\n\nROK sells two product families. The first is the automation and control group, and this division accounts for 53% of ROK’s revenues. This division sells software, hardware, and systems that help run the factory and control it. The second division is industrial automation, and this division accounts for 47% of ROK’s revenues. This division sells systems that manage machines in a factory.\n\nThe good news for ROK is that both divisions are growing. In the company’s most recent quarter, revenue from both divisions grew double digits. However, the software and control division grew much more quickly than the industrial automation division. Revenue from the software and control division grew 27% year over year, while revenue from the industrial automation division grew 11%.\n\nBut this is only part of the story. Because of the nature of ROK’s product families, ROK is able to sell products from one division to the other. That is, a company can buy automation software to run its machines, but then add control systems that are compatible with the software to make the factory run more efficiently.\n\nTo put this another way, a company can buy a ROK product for its machines, but then add another ROK product for the automation and control. That adds another 11% growth to the software and control revenue stream.\n\nIn fact, this is exactly what ROK has been doing. The industrial automation division has been growing more quickly than the software and control division, but it hasn’t been growing as quickly as it might have been. That’s because ROK has been using its software and control division to promote its industrial automation business.\n\nThat’s why the software and control division has been growing faster than the industrial automation division.\n\nIn addition, the industrial automation division hasn’t been growing as quickly as it might have been because the company is also using the software and control division to promote its industrial automation division.\n\nThe bottom line is that ROK has been able to make both divisions grow faster than they might have been growing, by using one division to promote the other. And this isn’t a trick. The two divisions are compatible. So ROK is actually growing these divisions together.\n\nIn other words, ROK is growing two divisions for double digit revenue growth.\n\n2. An acquisition in the industrial automation division, and more acquisitions\n\nOne of the reasons why ROK has been able to grow these two divisions for double digit revenue growth is because the company has been able to acquire companies that were compatible with its software and control systems, but were not competitive. This helps ROK offer more of what customers want, while reducing the amount of development that ROK has to do itself.\n\nFor example, in April of this year ROK acquired the assets of xsensor. In a press release ROK said, “The Company believes the purchase of xsensor will further expand its presence in the field of Wireless Industrial Automation, expanding its position as a full lifecycle provider of wireless industrial automation solutions.”\n\nThere are no similar language in press releases about acquisitions in the software and control division. So acquisitions in the industrial automation division are helping both divisions grow faster.\n\nAnd the acquisitions in the industrial automation division have been less complex and less expensive than the acquisitions in the software and control division. So these acquisitions will be less costly than the acquisitions in the software and control division, which means that ROK can continue to grow the industrial automation division faster than it’s growing the software and control division.\n\n3. A company that knows how to grow both divisions, and how to manage the growth\n\nBack in June I wrote about the growth story in the industrial automation division, and suggested that this division would continue to grow faster than the software and control division.\n\nIn the comments to this article, one investor wrote that he thought that the software and control division would continue to grow faster than the industrial automation division.\n\nI think he was wrong, and here’s why. In its most recent quarter, the industrial automation division showed some problems in its manufacturing and financial systems divisions.\n\nA company that knows how to grow the software and control division, and manages the growth of this division, is more likely to manage the growth of the industrial automation division than a company that doesn’t know how to manage the growth of the software and control division.\n\nHere’s why. When a company is growing, it often finds that it needs to make acquisitions in order to keep growing. This is the case with both divisions at ROK. When ROK needs to make an acquisition, it needs to make a judgment about the quality of the acquisition. If it’s a poor quality acquisition, then the division it’s adding could be a drag on the division it’s adding to.\n\nSo the more complex a division is, the more likely that ROK will get a bad acquisition, and the more likely it will be that the bad acquisition will hurt the other division. And the more likely it will be that the other division will have a problem, and that the other division will have a problem.\n\nThis is where managing growth is important. A company that knows how to grow one division, and manages the growth of this division, is more likely to know how to grow the other division, and manage the growth of the other division.\n\n4. A company that knows how to manage a declining business\n\nIn its most recent quarter, ROK had a declining business in its discrete manufacturing business. This is the business where ROK sells discrete controls, such as circuit breakers and fuses.\n\nOver the last few years, ROK has been losing share in this market, and this quarter it lost more share.\n\nThe problem that the company has is that its new products can’t displace its older products, because they can’t operate together. So ROK is going to have to keep selling its older products in this business, because it has no alternative.\n\nROK is trying to mitigate the problems in this business by reducing costs, and trying to promote its other businesses.\n\nThe problem is that the amount that the company can reduce costs in this business is limited, because this is a mature business, and ROK has already been cutting costs in this business for a long time.\n\nSo it looks like ROK is going to continue to see declining revenues in this business, and it’s going to continue to see declining margins in this business.\n\nHowever, the company has a history of managing declining businesses. For example, ROK’"
