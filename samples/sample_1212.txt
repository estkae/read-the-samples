Early on Saturday morning, the NSA released a statement regarding the recent allegations of a direct backdoor into Huawei's hardware, reports The Wall Street Journal.\n\nNational Security Agency chief Gen. Keith Alexander said on Saturday that media reports claiming the U.S. has been spying on Chinese technology giant Huawei are wrong and that the agency is not "stealing" corporate secrets from the firm. "I can tell you factually we do not have access to Huawei's networks, nor do we provide any Chinese company, including Huawei, access to our networks," Alexander told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe WSJ quotes Alexander as saying that "we would like [to clear this up] but we can't because it's classified," which is a strange statement, considering the agency released the statement publicly. The U.S. government has been accused of spying on Huawei after classified documents leaked by former contractor Edward Snowden claimed that the NSA was able to intercept network hardware ordered by foreign countries, such as routers and servers, reports Reuters. The latest accusation was published on Saturday by Der Spiegel, which said the NSA had placed so-called spyware on nearly 100,000 computers and servers around the world.\n\nAlexander said the U.S. government has been forced to be aggressive in spying on other countries because it faces cyber attacks every day. "The fact is we face cyber attacks from China, from Russia, from terrorist groups and individual hackers every single day," he said.
