Cleveland Police Officers Told Not to Shoot for Themselves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleveland Police officers in the city’s First and Second Districts are being told not to shoot at people who shoot at them first.\n\nOfficers are being ordered to let suspects shoot them first, so they don’t accidentally hit any citizens in the line of fire.\n\nThe decision comes after the Cuyahoga County Sheriff’s Department reviewed a video of a November 16th incident in which officers shot at a man who fired a gun into the air outside the University Inn on Lakeside Avenue.\n\nThe suspect fled the scene, but was arrested. The man who was shot at, was a patron inside a nearby lounge who was struck in the leg by a stray bullet fired by officers.\n\n“I just felt the bullet hit my leg and I looked and I saw a hole in my leg and I was like ‘what just happened?’” said Tonya Frazier. “The whole thing happened so fast I didn’t really know.”\n\nShe said she didn’t feel pain and there was no blood at first.\n\nOfficers at the scene treated the wound by putting towels on it, then put her on a chair and put a bandage over the wound.\n\n“If it wasn’t for the bulletproof vest and for him taking me to the ground, I probably wouldn’t be here today,” said Frazier.\n\nPolice Chief Calvin Williams said in a letter to officers that the decision was made because citizens were present and officers did not know who fired the shots.\n\nOfficers in the Cleveland Police Patrolmen’s Association were infuriated by the decision and say it places their lives in danger.\n\nUnion President Steve Loomis said the order is the direct result of the city of Cleveland settling with the Department of Justice on the consent decree and the slow down of training.\n\n“In effect, he’s going to have his officers shooting each other. That’s the end result of this,” said Loomis.\n\nSheriff’s Department Spokesman John O’Brien said in a statement that the union is focused on officers being placed at risk. He said the chief is giving officers the proper training, stressing that they cannot fire a weapon at someone shooting at them.\n\nDeputies found three guns at the scene. One of the guns had been reported stolen.\n\nUnion officials are calling for Loomis’ termination, citing the fact that he told them there was not enough money to train the department properly.\n\n© 2017 WKYC-TV
