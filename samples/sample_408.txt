The mooring cable holding the stricken Rena, which has been stranded on the Astrolabe Reef off the north east coast of New Zealand's North Island since October 5th 2011, is fraying at an "unacceptably rapid rate" and the ship could break up in as little as a week.\n\n\n\nIt could even go as early as Tuesday night, according to New Zealand authorities.\n\n\n\nThey had been expecting the ship to sink, as currents beneath the sea would pull the vessel into the reef, and it would begin to break apart as the tides took it apart. However the "churning" around the ship has actually been slowing the process of the ship disintegrating.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile the crews on board are clearing the decks of the ship, as the removal of the fuel is to begin today, a job which should take a week or two. The removal of the fuel would then free up the mooring cables and allow the ship to break apart and eventually sink.\n\n\n\nHowever if the cable did break, the pieces of the ship could drift away, or worse, float across the Hauraki Gulf and into the Bay of Plenty.\n\n\n\nThe most recent attempt to free the ship from the reef failed, with the bow slipping from the rocky coral. No one has been aboard the ship since a New Zealand Navy ship fired shots at it in January, when the Rena's crew threw their passports over the side.\n\n\n\nThe Chinese-flagged vessel broke free from its tugs in the Bay of Plenty and hit the Astrolabe Reef, spilling 1,700 tons of fuel into the sea. The damage to the reef has been assessed as being very severe.
