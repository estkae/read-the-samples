She had been in negotiations to join another team for the 2012 season before this testing opportunity arose.\n\n"She was on track with a test car and they had to put her in a race car," said Mark Johnson, IndyCar's director of racing operations.\n\nIndyCar drivers have been testing on the 1.022-mile track in preparation for next year's race, the second year of a multiyear deal to hold a race in the Southwest.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
