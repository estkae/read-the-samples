"Long held in awe as one of the most mysterious and haunting artefacts of ancient Egypt, the Great Pyramid of Giza has just given up one of its biggest secrets.\n\nAnd you don't even need an Indiana Jones hat to find it.\n\nThe secret, that has baffled archaeologists for centuries, is the 'burial chamber' within the monument. It's only the third ever discovered, and it's literally a hidden gem.\n\nMUST-SEE: This Was the Last Message Ever Received From the First Polar Satellite Launch\n\n\n\nAlthough many experts have theorised the purpose of the chamber, there has never been any solid evidence for it. The first was uncovered in 1837 by the British traveler Richard William Howard Vyse, but was then sealed again. The second was uncovered in the late 19th century by an Italian archaeologist.\n\nBut the latest, discovered by British architect and Egyptologist Dr. Kate Spence, was actually found with little more than a metal detector.\n\n"The chamber may also help to confirm that the Great Pyramid was built as a tomb for the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu, commonly known as Cheops," says Dr Spence.\n\n"Such a purpose is written on the walls of the pyramid's so-called Subterranean Chamber, which can only be reached via a tunnel.\n\n"The first clues to the possible location of the entrance to this tunnel are the marks on the wall of the Queen's Chamber."\n\nUsing a metal detector, Dr Spence discovered an anomaly in a corner of the room. It was only after researchers started cleaning the area that the discovery was made.\n\nDr. Spence told LiveScience that the anomaly was an open space, an empty spot in the rocks.\n\n"Once we removed all the broken debris, we could see that the 'openings' were cavities, possibly unexplored cavities, in the walls."\n\nThe team of researchers then followed the ancient tunnels, eventually finding the hidden door that led to the burial chamber.\n\n"You can actually see the different grains of sandstone," Dr. Spence said, "and there's a redder rock. And there's a certain type of black rock that is definitely not in the natural pyramid, which might be the signature of a particular stone that was brought from elsewhere to plug the shafts."\n\nThe chamber itself is tiny. It's 3.5 feet wide, 17 feet long and 8.6 feet high.\n\nBut its significance is huge.\n\n"The architecture of the pyramid suggests it was designed to focus on this small hidden room, so there is a good chance there may be something in there," Dr. Spence said.\n\nThe next step is for researchers to take a look inside.\n\nVia LiveScience
