Quality of Care Report\n\n\n\nThis Quality of Care Report is produced by Medicare and used to rank and rate the quality of health care facilities in the United States. The report is one of the best tools available to consumers to determine if a particular health care facility provides quality care to patients.\n\n\n\nNot all health care facilities receive a report. Those that do receive a report do so by meeting specific Medicare requirements.\n\n\n\nTo receive a report, a facility must:\n\n1. Accept Medicare patients.\n\n2. Operate a Medicare provider number.\n\n3. Report a minimum of 10% of all Medicare claims to Medicare in order to be statistically significant.\n\n4. Have a quality data set (QDS) of at least 3,000 patient records.\n\n5. Have at least three Medicare claims in the last three years.\n\n\n\nThese are the five requirements necessary for a facility to be eligible for a report.\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the report is only available to facilities that are using Medicare as their main billing source. If your facility is not eligible for a report, this means that your facility does not have a sufficient number of Medicare patients.\n\n\n\nCMS uses four categories for ranking facilities: A, B, C, and D. Each of these four categories are further divided into three levels, which are represented by three stars (***), two stars (**), and one star (*).\n\n\n\nA: Three Stars (***)\n\nB: Two Stars (**)\n\nC: One Star (*)\n\n\n\nSo, the better the facility performs, the higher the rating will be. If a facility does not receive a report, the rating will be "**" (two stars). This is an indication that there were not enough patients with Medicare coverage.\n\n\n\nA one star (*), two star (**), or three star (***) rating, is also called a "star" rating. A star rating is the result of an extensive quality assessment.\n\n\n\nYou may also see the stars translated into an A, B, C, and D rating. A is the highest, D is the lowest. A three star (***) facility is a higher rating than a two star (**) facility.\n\n\n\nAs a rule, consumers tend to focus on the star ratings. The star ratings are usually given first and the detailed information on how the star ratings were determined comes second. A three star (***) rating means the facility performed better than the majority of facilities within the same category. But, there is more information that you need to know.\n\n\n\nIf your facility is eligible for a report, the report will be published on your facility's Medicare profile. To find the profile, go to Medicare's home page and search for your facility. Then, click on "find patient's doctor."\n\n\n\nClicking on the link will open your facility's Medicare profile. In the profile, the report will be listed under "quality of care." The report is located at the bottom of the page.\n\n\n\nTo access the report, click on "quality of care." Your report will then be displayed. You will also see a table that shows how your facility performed in comparison to other facilities in the same category.\n\n\n\nThe report is broken down into two sections. The first section shows how the facility performed for specific services. The second section shows the overall star rating of the facility.\n\n\n\nFor specific services, the report shows how your facility performed compared to other facilities. The report also shows the facility's star rating and the percentage of Medicare patients the facility has treated.\n\n\n\nThe overall star rating shows how the facility did compared to other facilities within the same category. The overall star rating will show the facility's ranking, its star rating, and the number of stars the facility received.\n\n\n\nThe following is a brief overview of the report, the first section, and the second section.\n\n\n\nThe first section contains five sections. Each section deals with a specific area. They are listed as follows:\n\n\n\n- Key quality measures\n\n- Performance and outcomes\n\n- Patient experience\n\n- Staffing\n\n- Provider contract\n\n\n\nWithin each section, the report includes information on the following:\n\n\n\n- The number of eligible patients the facility had within a certain period of time\n\n- How the facility compared to the national average and other facilities within the same category\n\n- How the facility's patients compare to national data\n\n- The amount of improvement the facility has made over time\n\n\n\nThe first section gives detailed information on how the facility is performing in relation to the national average.\n\n\n\nThe second section is the overall star rating. It shows the facility's overall ranking, its star rating, and the number of stars it received. The overall star rating is the most important part of the report because it indicates how the facility performed compared to other facilities within the same category.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, not all facilities are eligible for a report. If your facility is eligible, a report will be available on your facility's Medicare profile. Consumers can access the report by going to Medicare's home page and searching for their facility.\n\n\n\nThen, they can click on "find patient's doctor." Clicking on the link will open the facility's Medicare profile. In the profile, the report will be listed under "quality of care." Clicking on the report will display the report.\n\n\n\nIf your facility is eligible for a report, it is important to read the report carefully. It provides detailed information on the quality of care your facility provides. This information is very important for your facility to maintain and improve its service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
