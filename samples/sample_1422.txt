"Now there’s a timeline that speaks for itself! You know I love all the different artistic angles you can take when creating a timeline. Some are very literal, others are fun and playful, and some are incredibly beautiful. In this case, all of these come into play when you take a look at this timeline of events of the creation of the universe.\n\nTimelines are always fascinating, but when you take a look at this timeline of the events of the creation of the universe, you will be blown away by just how much there is to know about the creation of the universe and all of the events leading up to and after it. As you can see in the photo above, the timeline starts with the beginning of the universe and continues through to the end of the universe, showing you how long the universe has been in existence, what occurred during that time, and even when we think it will end. And the most incredible part is, we actually have a lot of concrete evidence to back up this timeline!\n\nBelow you will find a series of different images, each one of them showing a different section of the timeline that is absolutely incredible.\n\n1. It all starts at the big bang, which occurred approximately 13.7 billion years ago.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n2. Then there is a period of rapid expansion, which scientists call inflation.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n3. And during this period of inflation, the entire universe is born.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n4. During this time, quarks and gluons form to make up the basic ingredients for all matter.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n5. Then the quarks and gluons combine into protons and neutrons.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n6. The universe is filled with hydrogen and helium.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n7. The first stars are formed, which eventually become black holes.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n8. The black holes suck in more and more matter, eventually growing bigger and bigger.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n9. Eventually, the stars die and become supernovas, scattering the universe with the necessary elements for new stars and planets.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n10. Galaxies form, along with the nebulae, black holes, stars and planets.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n11. The earth is formed.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n12. Then 4.5 billion years ago, life begins.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n13. Over time, life on earth begins to evolve and diversify.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n14. Eventually, humans appear.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n15. About 13.7 billion years after the beginning, life ends, marking the end of the universe.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\nI find the entire timeline fascinating, and I really like how it shows how everything seems to fit together. The most important part of this timeline is that it is backed up by science. It’s pretty amazing to know that we are able to actually know when all of these events occurred, as well as when they will occur. How do you like this timeline? It is one of my favorites to date!
