"CONAKRY, Guinea â€” A military officer says the death toll from Ebola in Guinea has passed 2,000.\n\nMamadou Samake said Friday that 2,127 deaths from Ebola have been reported in the West African nation. He says more than 5,600 suspected or confirmed cases have been reported in Guinea alone.\n\nThe current outbreak, which began in February, has hit Liberia the hardest. It has also hit Guinea and Sierra Leone.\n\nThe World Health Organization has reported more than 8,000 cases and nearly 4,000 deaths. The death toll may never be known, though, since some victims have buried their loved ones in secret to avoid stigma.\n\nSamake said new cases continue to appear in Guinea.\n\nHe says that over the next few weeks, authorities will be holding meetings with religious and traditional leaders to raise awareness and seek their help in fighting Ebola.
