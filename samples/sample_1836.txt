Daily Doppler weather radar imagery and surface observations from the National Weather Service (NWS) for the continental United States (CONUS). The system uses the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) infrastructure and interfaces with NWS radar and surface observation data via the Internet to support forecasting and situational awareness. NWS data sets can be accessed and displayed on a map with 1km, 5km, or 15km radar resolution, and with 1km, 4km, or 8km grid resolution for surface data.
