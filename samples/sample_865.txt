Selling my Peavey Valveking 112 this amp has served me well and i love it, however I am trying to move in a new direction. I am selling this for a new 6 string and my whole setup has changed. The tubes and heads are all clean. I purchased new Eminence Deltas for it, which I will give to you as well. There are also new tubes that I will give you. This is a great amp and I am only selling it because I want to go a different direction with my guitar playing. If you have any questions I am more than happy to answer them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 112 Valveking is more than capable of performing on any stage with its 2-12" Eminence Delta speakers, integrated spring reverb, and single-channel design. The Peavey 112 features the same sturdy, high-quality construction that you've come to expect from Peavey. The tube complement consists of two 12AX7 preamp tubes and two 6L6GC power amp tubes, which provides the 112 with 100 watts of power. Other features include Normal, Drive, and More Drive channels; independent Gain and Master controls; a 3-band EQ; an effects loop; a bright switch; a line out; and an FX-Loop/Switchable Channels footswitch.\n\nModel: ValveKing 112\n\nPart Number: 513031\n\n\n\n\n\nPeavey ValveKing 112 Guitar Amplifier Specs:\n\n\n\n\n\n• Tube-driven 100W\n\n• 2-12" Eminence Delta speakers\n\n• Integrated spring reverb\n\n• Single-channel design\n\n• Drive, More Drive, and Normal channels\n\n• Independent Gain and Master controls\n\n• 3-band EQ with contour\n\n• Effects loop\n\n• Bright switch\n\n• Line out\n\n• FX-Loop/Switchable Channels footswitch\n\n• Side handles for easy carrying\n\n• Rubber feet\n\n• Input: 4 ohms\n\n• Power: 100 watts\n\n• Dimensions: 18" x 27.5" x 11.75"\n\n• Weight: 31 pounds
