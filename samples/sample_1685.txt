WASHINGTON, D.C. - Nearly a dozen U.S. Senators, including Ohio’s Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), signed a letter to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) urging the agency to take swift action on its investigation into Google.\n\n“[Google] has a clear and pervasive dominance in search and search advertising,” the letter reads. “They are in a position to set the rules for the entire online marketplace.”\n\nThe letter points to the potential risks of allowing Google to continue to operate unchecked, such as using its power to shut out competition and “discriminate against rivals.”\n\n“We are deeply concerned that Google may have engaged in unlawful conduct to secure its dominant position,” the letter continues.\n\nBrown is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee and is a member of the Senate Commerce Committee.
