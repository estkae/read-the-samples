The Minnesota Vikings have yet to take the field for training camp. The NFL has yet to play a down.\n\nBut this season has all the makings of a disaster. The Vikings will almost certainly take a step backward in 2017 after a tremendous season that saw them nearly make the NFC Championship Game.\n\nWhat makes this season look even worse for Minnesota is the competition. The NFC North features three teams, including the Vikings, with a chance to contend for the division title. And in the NFC, the Seattle Seahawks and Atlanta Falcons aren't going anywhere.\n\nHere are three reasons why the Vikings will not only fail to make the playoffs, but also have a losing record this season:\n\n3. The Vikings don't have a quarterback\n\nThis might be the NFL's weakest quarterback division, which is why it's so hard to find a reason the Vikings will make the playoffs. Case Keenum might be the best of the bunch, but he's not an elite quarterback.\n\nThe Vikings need Keenum to play well to compete, but he has not shown the ability to do that. We saw what happens to the Vikings' defense when the offense struggles last season, and the Vikings aren't about to win games 17-13 or 20-17 this season. They need a quarterback to take them over the top, but they don't have one.\n\nRelated This Vikings rookie is drawing a lot of comparisons to Brett Favre\n\n2. The Vikings have a tough schedule\n\nThis should be an obvious point, but it's not. Yes, the Vikings have a rough schedule, but it's the type of schedule a team with a lot of talent can beat. The Vikings have some tough games on their schedule, including the Falcons, Buccaneers and Lions, but there are winnable games, too.\n\nThe Vikings will face the Buccaneers at home, which is a winnable game. They also play the Bears, Bengals and Browns, which should give them a chance to pick up a few wins. The Falcons and Lions are better than the Bears, Bengals and Browns, but they're not unbeatable.\n\nThis isn't an impossible schedule, but it's hard to win with an average quarterback.\n\n1. The Vikings' defense could take a step back\n\nMinnesota's defense was truly elite last season. The Vikings ranked fourth in points allowed, which was a big reason they were able to get to the NFC Championship Game.\n\nBut their defense could take a step back this season. Anthony Barr will return to linebacker after spending most of last season at outside linebacker, which will help the Vikings' defense. But Minnesota has questions at linebacker that could be problematic, which is one reason why the Vikings ranked as our 19th-best defense heading into the season.\n\nThe Vikings have a lot of defensive talent, but there's a lot of uncertainty, too.
