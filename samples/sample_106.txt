"Another Apple Exec Talks About Bringing Down The Cost Of Macs\n\nOn the heels of some recent remarks by Apple’s Phil Schiller about the company’s view on entry-level pricing, the current vice president of worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller, was quoted today in a Wall Street Journal article about PC prices.\n\nSchiller says that for the sake of keeping PC prices down, the platform needs to avoid fragmentation by maintaining one version of Windows that’s supported by all vendors. “That helps the consumer know that if I buy a PC in the next six months, it’s going to run that software. That’s good for consumers, and it helps keep prices down,” he told the newspaper.\n\nThose remarks are similar to what Schiller had to say about Apple’s Mac sales earlier this month, when he told analysts during a conference call that the company’s philosophy is to not “give customers a lot of choices.”\n\nHe also said that Apple has taken a different approach to pricing compared to its competitors. “It’s like when you go into a restaurant, you know what the food is going to cost. You don’t have to go through five steps of saying I want the steak for this much money, the chicken for this much money, the pasta for this much money.”\n\n“We’re not trying to segment or isolate ourselves from anybody,” Schiller said. “It’s more like, if you want a Mac, this is the price. If you want a PC, go over here.”\n\n[Source]
