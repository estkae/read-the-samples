John Mayer Just Made A Fool Of Himself In An Interview With The New York Times\n\nBy James Wilson-Taylor\n\n"We love to focus on my flaws and make them bigger than they are."\n\nJohn Mayer has come out fighting in a new interview with the New York Times, discussing a range of topics including the ghostwriting controversy, his upcoming tour with the Dead & Company and the end of the line for the John Mayer Trio.\n\nThe article details a frank conversation with the singer, in which he shares his honest thoughts on everything from his troubled past, to his use of social media, to the over-analytical nature of modern day music criticism.\n\nThe interview was conducted as a two-day workshop with NYU's music journalism department, which of course meant that the whole thing was promptly picked over by the internet on Tuesday night.\n\nHere's a selection of the choicest cuts:\n\nHis Vocal Fry Controversy:\n\n"The most controversial thing I’ve done recently is affect a slightly looser, lower register on some songs, which I think makes the songs more interesting."\n\nOn Taking Himself Less Seriously:\n\n"I remember thinking I have a platform and I have a microphone and I have a position of power, so let me try to change some things, maybe for the better. And people did not like that. I remember having this conversation where somebody said to me, ‘When you are perceived as yourself, people have a hard time relating to that.’ And I said, ‘I think you are misperceiving yourself to be someone who has a choice.’ I’m not saying this like, ‘Hey, world, my message is this, and you’re going to like it.’ That’s not what it’s about. It’s about the moment in which you are caught off guard, and you’re on tour and you’re not doing what you’re supposed to be doing, but you’re still getting a check."\n\nOn The Benefits Of Ghostwriting:\n\n"I don’t have any beef with the world. I’ve got a bunch of kids and a beautiful girlfriend and a house that I love and that’s not an accident. And I’ve worked for that and I’ve gotten that because I’m an easygoing guy who really enjoys life. And I’ve always been super-vigilant about my ability to access joy."\n\nOn Being A 'Bubblegum Pop Star':\n\n"I was, for a very brief period of time, a bubblegum pop star. I was in the No. 1 pop band of the late-’90s, early 2000s. I’ve had 18 or 19 top 10 songs. I have the right to call myself a singer, I guess. But I would never want to turn my back on being a guitar player and a songwriter. And the reason why is because I have a fan base that loves me for being a guitar player and a songwriter, and it’s very separate from the people who like my pop songs."\n\nHis Concert Review Regrets:\n\n"I was like, ‘Look, we’re going to be under these bright lights, and it’s going to be this one moment in time where we’re going to play it for you. And we want to give you the most you can get for your dollar.’ And then I think I had a bad couple of years. And I lost myself and tried to get myself back, and now I’m playing shows where, like, I’m not having a good time."\n\nOn Live Music Criticism:\n\n"I think we’re overintellectualizing music. The discussion about music is so myopic and minuscule. ‘He did this, and it’s a disservice to this particular song.’ And I’m like, well, maybe you don’t like this song. If you don’t like it, just don’t buy it. But that’s not the way it works anymore. So I think we’ve been eating the meat and spitting out the bones. You just want to get the marrow."\n\nThe New York Times concludes by highlighting the vocal coaching he undertook in 2015 in order to overcome his vocal issues:\n\n"I went and saw a vocal coach who I had seen when I was on my 'John Mayer's Journey Continues' world tour. She was a big hero of mine. She’s the one who said to me, 'John, you just don’t like how you sound. Why don’t you do something about it?' I said, 'I can’t afford to do anything about it.’ She said, 'That’s not true.’ "\n\nWatch our video of John's recent live cover of 'A Hard Day's Night' here:
